✅[#1] INTRO VIEWS 

📌VIEWS :
-Views are the UI.
-View is the component that contains logic to represent the model data (the model data provided to it by a controller) as a user interface with which the end-user can interact.
-In short Views are the html pages which are having the extension as .cshtml, And this is called the razor syntax(C# + HTML).
- The View combines programming language (C#) and HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) and genrally re return to the client from the controller action methods.

📌TYPES OF VIEWS :
-Razor views
-Partial views
-View components
-Layout views

📌 1. Razor Views
Razor Views are .cshtml files that contain a mix of HTML and C# code using Razor syntax.
Razor syntax starts with @ to embed C# inside HTML.
These are the default view types used to render dynamic content in ASP.NET Core MVC.

Example:
🗂 Project Structure
/MyMvcApp
│
├── Program.cs
├── Startup.cs (if using .NET Core 3.1 or earlier)
│
├── /Controllers
│   └── HomeController.cs
│
├── /Views
│   └── /Home
│       └── Welcome.cshtml
│
├── /Views/Shared
│   └── _Layout.cshtml (optional)
│
├── /wwwroot
│   └── (static assets like CSS, JS)

📁 Code Files
1️⃣ Program.cs
//All code of Program.cs file, like AddMvc(), app.Userouting() etc
//All configuration code.

2️⃣ Controllers/HomeController.cs
Suppose you have a controller action:
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyMvcApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Welcome()
        {
            ViewBag.Name = "Alice";  //This is the paramters or data members, which can be used in the html page for passing data from the controller Actions.
            return View(); //this will return the HTML page, which is named as "Welcome.cshtml"
        }
    }
}
//Razor view engine renders the view, and reads the .cshtml file, parses the html and replaces @ViewBag.Name with Alice

3️⃣ Views/Home/Welcome.cshtml
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Welcome Page"; //This will set the "TITLE" of the html page which is seen in the browser top URL
}
<h2>Welcome, @ViewBag.Name!</h2>  //"@ViewBag.Name = alice" takes form controller.

OUTPUT :
User visits : http://localhost:5000/Home/Welcome
This will render: <h2>Welcome, Alice!</h2>

📌 2. Partial Views
These are reusable view components that can be embedded within other views.
They are useful for rendering common elements like headers, footers, or navigation menus.
Partial Views are reusable view fragments (sub-views).
Think of them as components that can be included inside other views.
They do not contain layout or complete HTML; instead, they focus on a portion of the UI.

Example:
Let's say you want to reuse a user profile card in multiple places.
Let’s build a simple ASP.NET Core MVC app to demonstrate:
A User model.
A HomeController returning a list of users.
A ParentView.cshtml that loops through users and injects _UserCard.cshtml.

📁 Code Files
1️⃣ Program.cs
//This include all the startup code, Which is needed for MVC configuration.
//app.AddMvc() , App.UseRouting() etc functions 

2️⃣ Models/User.cs
namespace MyMvcApp.Models
{
    public class User
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
    }
}

3️⃣ Controllers/HomeController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using MyMvcApp.Models;

namespace MyMvcApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult UserList()
        {
            var users = new List<User>
            {
                new User { Name = "Alice", Email = "alice@example.com" },
                new User { Name = "Bob", Email = "bob@example.com" },
                new User { Name = "Charlie", Email = "charlie@example.com" }
            };

            return View(users);  // Pass list of users to view
        }
    }
}

4️⃣ Views/Home/UserList.cshtml (Parent View)
@model List<MyMvcApp.Models.User>
<h2>User List</h2>

@foreach (var user in Model)
{
    @Html.Partial("_UserCard", user)  // Inject partial view with one user
}

5️⃣ Views/Home/_UserCard.cshtml (Partial View)

@model MyMvcApp.Models.User

<div class="user-card" style="border:1px solid #ccc; padding:10px; margin:5px;">
    <h4>@Model.Name</h4>
    <p>@Model.Email</p>
</div>


-User visits: http://localhost:5000/Home/UserList
ASP.NET Core finds:
Controller: HomeController
Action: UserList()
Returns view: Views/Home/UserList.cshtml with List<User> model.

-Use Case:
uh can use it in Repeating UI patterns like user cards, comment boxes, navigation menus, Header, Footer etc.

📌 3. View Components
-They are strongly-typed, reusable UI blocks that include:
A class for logic (C#)
A view for display (.cshtml).
-These are similar to partial views but more powerful. They can encapsulate both the view and the logic needed to generate it.
-What are they?
View Components are more powerful than partial views.
They include both logic (C#) and view (HTML) and are similar to mini-controllers + views.
They don’t use ViewBag or ViewData; instead, they use strongly typed models.

EXAMPLE
🧠 Real-Life Analogy
Imagine your website homepage needs to show:
🔥 “Top 3 Products of the Week”
Instead of writing that logic in a controller and passing it to a view, you encapsulate everything into a View Component that fetches data and renders it.

📂 Code Implementation
1️⃣ Program.cs
//This files inlcdues all the configuration code, needed to start and set up the MVC and middle weres like app.useRouting(), app.AddMvc()
//Add.UseDefalutRoute()   ---> middlewere
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
);

2️⃣ Controllers/HomeController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace MyMvcApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(); // Just loads Index.cshtml
        }
    }
}

3️⃣ ViewComponents/TopProductsViewComponent.cs  :💡 This is your reusable logic class.
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace MyMvcApp.ViewComponents
{
    // View Component class must inherit from ViewComponent
    public class TopProductsViewComponent : ViewComponent
    {
        // This method is called when using @await Component.InvokeAsync("TopProducts")
        public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
        {
            // Simulate fetching top products (could be from DB)
            var products = GetTopProducts();
            return View(products);  // Looks for /Views/Shared/Components/TopProducts/Default.cshtml
        }

        private List<string> GetTopProducts()
        {
            return new List<string> { "Laptop", "Phone", "Tablet" };
        }
    }
}

4️⃣ Views/Shared/Components/TopProducts/Default.cshtml : 📄 This is the view that gets rendered when the component is invoked.
@model List<string>
<h4>Top Products</h4>
<ul>
@foreach (var item in Model)
{
    <li>@item</li>
}
</ul>

5️⃣ Views/Home/Index.cshtml : 💡 Use the view component here with Component.InvokeAsync
<h2>Welcome to Our Store</h2>
<!-- Render the TopProducts component -->
@await Component.InvokeAsync("TopProducts")


🔄 How Does It Work Internally?
| Step                                          | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@await Component.InvokeAsync("TopProducts")` | Tells the framework to **look for** a View Component class named `TopProductsViewComponent`. |
| Framework finds `TopProductsViewComponent`    | Executes the `Invoke()` method and gets the list of products.                                |
| `return View(products)`                       | Automatically maps to the view at: `/Views/Shared/Components/TopProducts/Default.cshtml`     |
| Final Render                                  | The rendered HTML is injected into the parent view (e.g., `Index.cshtml`).                   |

-now uh can Use it in any view as: @await Component.InvokeAsync("TopProducts")
Just need to write this line in any view , and uh can use this page.
-Use Case:
uh can use it in Sidebar widgets, search boxes, shopping cart previews, etc.

💡 View Component Naming Convention
| Part          | Convention                                                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class         | Must end with `ViewComponent` (e.g., `TopProductsViewComponent`)                 |
| Invoke Method | You can use `Invoke()` or `InvokeAsync()`                                        |
| View File     | Named `Default.cshtml` inside `/Views/Shared/Components/{ComponentName}/` folder |

📌 4. Layout Views
Layouts are like templates or wrappers for your pages.
Instead of duplicating HTML (e.g., header/footer) in every view, you define it once in a layout.
- These provide a consistent look and feel across multiple views in your application.
They define a common template(define a common strture like master page) for your pages, including headers, footers, and navigation bars.
-What are they?
Layout Views provide a common template or structure (like a master page).
Helps maintain a consistent look and feel across multiple pages (e.g., same header, footer, menu).

Example:
Imagine your website is a book:
Layout View = Book cover, table of contents, same chapter layout
Individual Views = Actual content of each chapter

📁 Folder Structure

├── Program.cs
│
├── /Controllers
│   └── HomeController.cs
│
├── /Views
│   ├── /Home
│   │   └── Index.cshtml            ← Child View
│   └── /Shared
│       └── _Layout.cshtml          ← Layout Template


1️⃣ Program.cs
//Contains the configuration code for MVC and middle wres
app.AddMvc()
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}"
);


2️⃣ Controllers/HomeController.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyMvcApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View(); // Renders Views/Home/Index.cshtml
        }
    }
}


3️⃣ Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml: This is the layout file (like master page in WebForms).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewData["Title"] - My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>My Website</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="/">Home</a> |
            <a href="/Home/About">About</a> |
            <a href="/Home/Contact">Contact</a>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main role="main">
        <!-- This is where the child view will inject its content -->
        @RenderBody()
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

💬 Explanation:
@ViewData["Title"] — Page-specific title from child view.
@RenderBody() — This is where the child view content will be rendered.
Shared layout elements like header/footer are reused across all views.


4️⃣ Views/Home/Index.cshtml : This is a child view that will use _Layout.cshtml.

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page"; // Used in the <title> tag of layout
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"; // Specify the layout
}

<h2>Welcome to the Home Page</h2>
<p>This is your starting point!</p>


This results in:
<header>My Website</header>
<h2>Welcome to the Home Page</h2>
<footer>© 2025 My Website</footer>

🧠 How the Mapping Works Internally
| Step                                       | What Happens                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `return View();` in HomeController         | Tells ASP.NET to render `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`            |
| `Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"` | Tells ASP.NET to wrap the view inside this layout            |
| `@RenderBody()` in `_Layout.cshtml`        | Inserts the content from `Index.cshtml` at this point        |
| `@ViewData["Title"]`                       | Populates the layout's `<title>` dynamically from child view |


🔧 Bonus: Set Layout Globally (Optional)
Instead of setting Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml" in every view, you can set it once globally: 
Views/_ViewStart.cshtml
@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}
//Now you don't need to specify Layout = ... in every view unless you want to override it.

📝 Summary
| Concept              | Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `_Layout.cshtml`     | Master layout file for consistent UI   |
| `@RenderBody()`      | Injects child view content             |
| `@ViewData["Title"]` | Dynamically sets page title            |
| `@{ Layout = ... }`  | Specifies which layout to use          |
| `_ViewStart.cshtml`  | Optional file to globally apply layout |



Use Case:
Ensuring all views share common layout (header, footer, CSS/JS includes, etc.)


| View Type      | Purpose                                       | Contains Logic | Reusability     | Layout Support |

| Razor View     | Regular dynamic views                         | ❌              | ❌               | ✅              |
| Partial View   | Reusable fragments inside other views         | ❌              | ✅               | ❌              |
| View Component | Encapsulated UI + logic, reusable and dynamic | ✅              | ✅               | ❌              |
| Layout View    | Master page for consistent page structure     | ❌              | ✅ (across site) | ✅              |


-----------------✅[#2]VIEWS FOLDER-------------------------------

✅[#2]VIEWS FOLDER

📌 Basic Rule
All views go inside the Views folder.
Inside the Views folder, you create subfolders for each Controller in your application.
Each controller's views (HTML pages) are stored in its corresponding folder.
The name of each subfolder must match the controller name (without "Controller" suffix).

Folder Structure Example : Suppose you have these two controllers in your app:

📁Controllers/HomeController.cs
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index() { return View(); } //The return type of the Index() action method is ViewResult/IActionResult, which means it will return a view. To return a view, we use the View() extension method, which belongs to the Controller Base Class.
    public IActionResult AboutUs() { return View(); }
    public IActionResult ContactUs() { return View(); } //
}

-If uh navigate  to the “/Home/Index” URL
-MVC Framework will look for a file with the name Index.cshtml in the following three locations.
First, it will look for the “Index.cshtml” file within the “/Views/Home” folder, as the action method belongs to the Home Controller.
Then it will look for the “Index.cshtml” file in the “/Views/Shared/” folder.
Then it will look for the “Index.cshtml” file in the “/Pages/Shared/” folder.


📁Controllers/StudentController.cs
public class StudentController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index() { return View(); }
    public IActionResult Details() { return View(); }
    public IActionResult Edit() { return View(); }   // This "return view() " function looks for Views/Student/Edit.cshtml
    public IActionResult Delete() { return View(); }
}


🗂 View Folder Structure
/Views
│
├── /Home
│   ├── Index.cshtml //The URL "https:/port/Home/Index" will render this html page
│   ├── AboutUs.cshtml //The URL "https:/port/Home/AboutUs" will render this html page
│   └── ContactUs.cshtml
│
├── /Student
│   ├── Index.cshtml
│   ├── Details.cshtml  
│   ├── Edit.cshtml  // The URL "https:/port/Student/Edit" will render this "Edit.cshtml " html page
│   └── Delete.cshtml
│
├── /Shared
│   ├── _Layout.cshtml
│   ├── _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml
│   └── _ViewImports.cshtml


🧠 How It Works
When a user visits a URL like /Home/Index, the Index method in HomeController gets called.
The View() method returns a view file named Index.cshtml.
ASP.NET Core looks for this file in the Views/Home/ folder.
So, it renders Views/Home/Index.cshtml.

The same process happens for all controller actions:
/Student/Details → Views/Student/Details.cshtml
/Home/AboutUs → Views/Home/AboutUs.cshtml

📌Special Folders Inside Views
-Views/Shared/ : This folder is for shared views like:
Layouts (_Layout.cshtml)  //This page is share among all the veiws
Partial Views (like headers, footers) //Like footer is common for all the views
Error pages or common components

 🔹_ViewStart.cshtml
Optional file placed in Views/ or subfolders.
Used to automatically apply a layout to multiple views.

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

 🔹Summary
Views are stored inside the Views folder.
Each controller has its own subfolder under Views.
View files (.cshtml) are placed in the matching subfolder according to the action method names.
There’s also a Shared folder for reusable or common views like layout pages.


✅[#3]VIEWS DISCOVERY

📌VIEWS DISCOVERY 
-View Discovery in asp .net MVC core is a process by which the freamwork determines which view file to use when rendering a response to HTTP request
-This process (of view discovery) involves locating appropriate view file based on the action method and controller.

📌Understanding View() Method 
-This view() method is in the Controller base class, you will find four overload versions of the View() method available in Controller base class.

View() Method Overloads
-In ASP.NET Core MVC, the View() method of the Controller class has 4 main overloaded versions:

| Method Signature                      | When to Use                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `View()`                              | Return a view with **same name as action**; no data passed.  |
| `View(object model)`                  | Return a view with **same name as action**; pass data to it. |
| `View(string viewName)`               | Return a view with a **custom name**; no data passed.        |
| `View(string viewName, object model)` | Return a view with a **custom name** and pass data to it.    |


🎯 Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you're building custom invitations for different people.
View() → You use a default template because the person's name matches the invitation file (e.g., "John" uses John.cshtml).
View(object model) → You use a default template but add personal details like a message or address.
View("Birthday") → You manually select a template called "Birthday" instead of using "John" even though the request came from John.
View("Birthday", personData) → You use a "Birthday" template with John’s personalized data (name, age, etc.).


📌1. View()
🧠 When:
When the view name is same as action name.
No need to send any data to the view.


👇 Code:
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ViewResult Index() // Action name is "Index"
    {
        return View(); // Will load Views/Home/Index.cshtml
    }
}

📁 Folder: Views/Home/Index.cshtml
<h2>Welcome to Index View</h2>

🔍 How it works:
The action is Index.
The framework looks in Views/Home/Index.cshtml (same as controller name and action).
No model data passed.


📌 2. View(object model)
🧠 When:
You want to use the default view (Index.cshtml) but send data to it.

👇 Code:
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ViewResult Index()
    {
        string message = "Welcome to ASP.NET Core!";
        return View(model: message); // Pass string to view
    }
}

📁 Folder: Views/Home/Index.cshtml
@model string
<h2>@Model</h2> //this "@Model" is noth but the message passed.

🔍 How it works:
Still uses Views/Home/Index.cshtml.
Now you can access the model passed (string message) in the view via @Model.


📌3. View(string viewName)
🧠 When:
You want to return a view that is different from the action method name.
You do not need to pass data.

Setup:
Add a view file manually
📁 Views/Home/Test.cshtml
👇 View Code (Test.cshtml):
<h2>This is Test View</h2>

👇 Controller Code:
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ViewResult Index()
    {
        return View("Test"); // Loads Views/Home/Test.cshtml instead of Index.cshtml
    }
}//In this the "return view() will be the test view"
🔍 How it works:
The action is Index(), but the view loaded is "Test".
Useful when you want to reuse views across multiple actions.
 
📌4. View(string viewName, object model)
🧠 When:
You want to load a custom view file name and pass data to it.

👇 Controller Code:
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ViewResult Index()
    {
        var productList = new List<string> { "TV", "Laptop", "Phone" };
        return View("Test", productList); // Loads Test.cshtml and passes model
    }
}

📁 Views/Home/Test.cshtml
👇 View Code (Test.cshtml):
@model List<string>

<h2>Product List</h2>
<ul>
@foreach (var product in Model)
{
    <li>@product</li>
}
</ul>

🔍 How it works:
Action is Index().
Loads view file "Test.cshtml".
Sends a list of products to the view.
