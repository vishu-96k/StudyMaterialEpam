--------------MVC ARCHETECTURE-------------

✅ Understanding MVC Architecture
📌 Definition:
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern used to separate concerns in software applications. It divides the application into three components:
Model – Manages data and business logic (class which are mapped to database tables)
View – Handles the presentation layer (UI) (html and css)
Controller – Handles user input and updates Model/View accordingly (C# code, Like logic code js)


✅ Components of MVC Architecture
📌 1. Model 
-These are the classes in C#, which will be getting converted into SQL Tables using th EF (ERM model that I sthe entiyty relational mapper), Which will convert the Class Properties as the Colums, And the Objetcs of the class as the Specific data entry in the table.
🔷 Represents the data and business logic of the application
🔷 Responsible for getting, storing, and manipulating data
🔷 Often connects to a database using technologies like Entity Framework
EG:
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

📌 2. View
🔷 Responsible for the user interface (UI)
🔷 Displays data received from the controller
🔷 Uses Razor syntax in ASP.NET MVC (.cshtml files)

🔷 Example (Index.cshtml):
@model List<Product>

<h2>Product List</h2>
<ul>
@foreach (var product in Model)
{
    <li>@product.Name - $@product.Price</li>
}
</ul>

📌 3. Controller
🔷 Acts as a bridge between Model and View
🔷 Handles user input, calls the Model, and selects the appropriate View
🔷 Defines action methods that respond to HTTP requests
EG:
public class ProductController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        var products = new List<Product>
        {
            new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Laptop", Price = 800 },
            new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Mouse", Price = 20 }
        };

        return View(products); // Pass data to View
    }
}


✅ Flow of MVC Architecture
📌 Step-by-step Request Flow:
🔷 User types URL /Product/Index in browser
🔷 Routing system directs request to ProductController → Index()
🔷 Controller fetches data (e.g., from a Model or database)
🔷 Controller sends data to the View
🔷 View renders the HTML and sends it to the browser


✅ Advantages of MVC Architecture
🔷 Separation of Concerns – Code is cleanly separated
🔷 Maintainability – Easy to update or scale each component
🔷 Testability – Easy to test Models and Controllers independently
🔷 Reusability – Views and Models can be reused in different parts of the app


✅ Real-World Analogy
📌 Think of an online food ordering app:
🔷 Model – Menu items, prices, and order details (data)
🔷 View – The webpage or mobile screen showing the menu
🔷 Controller – Handles button clicks, processes the order, updates the view


✅ MVC Project Folder Structure in ASP.NET MVC
📌 Typical folder structure:
/Models
    Product.cs
/Controllers
    ProductController.cs
/Views
    /Product
        Index.cshtml


✅ Controller 
✅ What is a Controller in ASP.NET MVC?
📌 Definition:
🔷 A Controller is a class in ASP.NET MVC that handles user requests, processes them (often by interacting with the model), and returns a response (typically a View or data UI).
🔷 It acts as the intermediary between the Model (data layer) and View (presentation layer).
🔷 Controllers are part of the MVC pattern: Model–View–Controller.


✅ What Does a Controller Do?
📌 Primary Responsibilities:
🔷 Accepts HTTP Requests from the browser (like GET, POST).
🔷 Performs operations like reading data, updating the model, or performing business logic.
🔷 Chooses which View to render as the response.
🔷 Can return JSON, Redirect, File, or other content types.


✅ How Does a Controller Work?
📌 Request Handling Flow:
🔷 When a user visits a URL like /Products/Details/5, MVC routes this request to the ProductsController, and calls its Details method with the ID 5.
🔷 The controller action (method) fetches data (e.g., product details from the database), processes it if needed, and then passes it to a View to be rendered.
📌 Internally:
🔷 ASP.NET MVC uses Routing to map URL paths to controller actions.
🔷 Controllers inherit from System.Web.Mvc.Controller.
🔷 Controllers can access the Request, Response, Session, and HttpContext directly.
🔷 Controllers return an ActionResult (e.g., View(), RedirectToAction(), Json(), etc.).

✅ What Is the Use of a Controller?
📌 Key Benefits:
🔷 Ensures Separation of Concerns – keeps logic (controller), data (model), and UI (view) separate.
🔷 Makes code maintainable and testable – logic is not tied to UI or data access.
🔷 Allows reusability of actions across different views or APIs.
🔷 Makes application scalable and easier to extend.


✅ Example of a Controller in ASP.NET MVC:
📌 C# Code Example:

public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    // Action to show a list of products
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        var products = ProductRepository.GetAll(); // Get data from model
        return View(products); // Pass data to view
    }

    // Action to show details of a specific product
    public ActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var product = ProductRepository.GetById(id);
        if (product == null)
        {
            return HttpNotFound(); // Return 404 if not found
        }
        return View(product); // Pass product to view
    }

    // Action to handle form submission
    [HttpPost]
    public ActionResult Create(Product model)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            ProductRepository.Add(model);
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(model); // Return to the form if validation fails
    }
}

📌 Explanation: 🔷 ProductsController handles product-related actions.
🔷 Index() – fetches a list of products and returns it to the Index view.
🔷 Details(int id) – fetches one product by ID and sends it to the Details view.
🔷 Create(Product model) – handles form submission to create a product.

✅ Common Return Types in Controller Actions:
📌 Types of ActionResult:
🔷 View() – Returns a view (.cshtml page).
🔷 RedirectToAction() – Redirects to another action.
🔷 Json() – Returns data in JSON format (useful for APIs/AJAX).
🔷 Content() – Returns plain text or HTML.
🔷 File() – Sends a file to the browser.
🔷 HttpNotFound() – Returns 404 error.
🔷 PartialView() – Returns a partial view (for partial page updates).

✅ Conclusion:
📌 Controller = Brain of MVC Application
🔷 It accepts input, processes it using business logic or data access, and sends back a response.
🔷 It keeps the app organized and follows the MVC principle to enhance maintainability, scalability, and testability.


------------------MVC--ROUTING--------------------

✅ Understanding ASP.NET MVC Routing
📌 Definition:
ASP.NET MVC Routing is a mechanism that maps incoming browser requests to specific controller actions. This allows for clean, user-friendly URLs that are not tied to physical files on the server 

✅ How Routing Works in ASP.NET MVC
📌 Core Components:
🔷 Route: Defines a URL pattern and the handler (controller and action) for that pattern.
🔷 Route Table: A collection of routes that the application uses to match incoming requests.
🔷 Routing Engine: Processes incoming requests and matches them to the appropriate route in the route table.


📌 Default Route:
By default, ASP.NET MVC includes a route defined as:
EG :
routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Default",
    url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
);

🔷 Explanation:
{controller}: Specifies the controller name.
{action}: Specifies the action method within the controller.
{id}: An optional parameter that can be used to pass additional data
For example, a URL like /Product/Details/5 would be mapped to the Details action of the Product controller with an id of 5.


✅ Types of Routing in ASP.NET MVC
📌 1. Convention-Based Routing
🔷 Routes are defined in a centralized location, typically in the RouteConfig.cs file.
🔷 Follows a consistent pattern across the application

📌 2. Attribute Routing
🔷 Introduced in ASP.NET MVC 5, allowing developers to define routes directly on controller actions using attributes.
🔷 Provides more control and flexibility over URL patterns.
EG :
[Route("products/{id}")]
public ActionResult Details(int id)
{
    // Action logic here
}
This route would match URLs like /products/5 and direct them to the Details action.

✅ Customizing Routes
📌 Defining Custom Routes:
You can define custom routes to match specific URL patterns:
routes.MapRoute(
    name: "CustomRoute",
    url: "store/{category}/{id}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Store", action = "Browse", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
);
This route would match URLs like /store/electronics/5 and direct them to the Browse action of the Store controller with category as "electronics" and id as 5.

✅ Benefits of Using Routing
🔷 Clean URLs: Provides user-friendly and SEO-friendly URLs.
🔷 Decoupling: Separates URL structure from the physical file structure.
🔷 Flexibility: Allows for complex URL patterns and parameter passing.
🔷 Maintainability: Centralized route definitions make it easier to manage and update URL patterns.



--------------------MVC PART 3-----YT NOTES-----------------



-----------------MVC vs ASP .net MVC-----------

MVC and ASP .net MVC : Both the things are different.

-MVC: MODEL VIEW CONROLLER.
-REAL LIFE ANOLOGY : PIIZA STORE, Waiter takes the order from the user, Waiter gives the order to the cook and prepares the pizza and gives it to the waiter, waiter will take the pizza and give it to the user.
-Waiter = Controller
-Input = MODEL
-Pizza = View
-MVC is Design pattern

WHAT IS MVC :
-MVC is a Design Pattern, Which can be used with any technologt, like java cpp, php, Python, .net, Spring Freamwrok etc.
-MVC Can be used for making web, Mobile, Desktop application.

WHAT IS ASP.NET MVC :
-Microsoft used MVC to interigate it with .net and named it as ASP .NET MVC	
-ASP .NET MVC is a .Net framework which follows MVC DESIGN PATTERN 
-ASP .NET MVC provides eveurthing required to build a web application using MVC design PAttern
-ASP .net MVC 5, MICROSOFT used MVC and build a freamwrok and named it as ASP .net MVC under the .net PLATFORM.
-ASP .Net MVC is used only for building Web application in .net (not for mobile and other application, There is diff framwokrs for diff types of application in .net platfrom).


REQUIRED THINGS FOR USING ASP .NET MVC :
-.Net Freamwork
-IDE(visual Studio)
-ASP .net Freamwork
