WHAT IS In PROCESS and Out PROCESS HOSTING
WHAT IS IIS, IIS EXPRESS, KESTRAL WebSERVERS
WHAT IS DIFF BETWEEN ALL, ASP, APS .NET, ASP .NET CORE, MVC, API, API MVC etc.

----------------PART 1 ::-----PROJECT STRUCTURE ------------

✅ASP .net CORE 
-ASP .net is not web forms, ASP.NET is a broader framework that includes different models like:
Web Forms (older UI-based model),
MVC (Model-View-Controller),
Web API, and
ASP.NET Core (modern, cross-platform version).
-ASP.NET Core is not the same as Web Forms. ASP.NET Core is a modern, cross-platform web framework, while Web Forms is an older, Windows-only framework for building UI using drag-and-drop controls.

📌PROJECT STRUCTURE 

FirstCoreWEbApplication  //This is the project name under the solution, We have created a empty templated web application in asp .net core
	-Connected Services
	-Dependencies
	-Properties
	-appsettings.json
	-Program.cs

🔷1. Connected Services
-This is used for connecting to external services such as AZURE.
-it helps to add the external functionality into our application, so that we can connect to the external services(like DB , AWS S3).
-A Visual Studio feature that allows your app to easily connect to external services.
-You can add services like:
Azure Storage
REST APIs
gRPC
WCF services
Database connectors
- Real-life Analogy:
Imagine your app is like a smart home system. Connected Services are like adding external smart devices (e.g., Google Assistant, smart thermostat) to work with your system.

-Example:
You add an Azure Blob Storage service:
Visual Studio adds required NuGet packages
Configures credentials in appsettings.json
Adds a client class to connect with the Azure service.

🔷 2. Dependencies
-This folder included and manages all the libraries your applucatoin is using.
-All the libraries which uh install using the Nuget package manager is inlucded in this folder
-That means it includes both built-in ASP.NET Core libraries and third-party libraries you might add later to enhance your application’s functionality.
-Contains NuGet packages, SDKs, and .NET libraries your app needs to run or build.
-🛠️ Real-life analogy:
Imagine building a house — dependencies are like cement, bricks, screws, windows.
-Two important metapackages will always be inlcuded:
a. Microsoft.NETCore.App : basic tools (hammer, drill, ruler)
b. Microsoft.AspNetCore.App : specialized tools (tile cutter, electric saw) for web development.

📌Microsoft.NETCore.App
-it includes the BCL and .Net run time, which all .net aplications requires to run.
-Core libraries that allow any .NET app to run. 
- What it includes:
Runtime: Code execution engine.
Core Libraries:
System.IO (File reading/writing)
System.Linq (Data filtering and transformation)
System.Threading (Multithreading)
System.Collections (Lists, dictionaries)

EG:
var names = new List<string> { "John", "Jane" };
var upperNames = names.Select(name => name.ToUpper()).ToList();

You're using LINQ and Collections from Microsoft.NETCore.App.

📌Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
-This includes the extra libraris wihch uh install using the nuget package manager.
-This package provides the features like ORM , Entity framwrok, MVC , Razor Pages, API, Controllers, the packages(namespaces)/ Libraries which are required for these features to be used in our application are in this file.
-Extra libraries for ASP.NET Core apps like:
MVC
Razor
Entity Framework
Middleware
Identity

🛠️ Real-life analogy:
Imagine you’re building a website. .NETCore.App is your computer’s OS, but AspNetCore.App gives you a web browser, a website builder, and tools like WordPress.

Example Code (Controller):
public class HomeController : Controller
{
public IActionResult Index()
{
return View();
}
}

 What it includes:
MVC & Razor Pages (UI rendering, controllers)
Entity Framework Core (Database access)
Middleware (Routing, error handling, static files, logging)
Authentication/Authorization (Identity, roles)
Dependency Injection (DI) system
Configuration system

EG:
If you want user login, you’ll use:
services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<AppDbContext>();

This comes from Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.

-Microsoft.NETCore.App provides the core functionality needed to run any .NET Core application. Microsoft.AspNetCore.App extends Microsoft.NETCore.App and add ASP.NET Core-specific libraries and functionality that are essential for building and running web applications.

🔷3. Analyzers
-Means it is intregated with vs code so that when uh are writing the code, the code is analize and quality of code is maintained.
-Real-time tools that analyze your code and warn you about:Bad practices
Bugs
Missing comments or wrong formatting

🛠️ Real-life analogy:
Think of it like Grammarly for your C# code. It watches while you type and suggests corrections.

👨‍💻 Example:
If you declare a variable and never use it:
int unused = 5; // ⚠ Warning from analyzer



🔷4. Properties / launchSettings.json
-it tells how the application is going to run/start  locally, on which server etc
-Holds the launchSettings.json file, which configures how the app runs locally.
- It defines the environment, URLs, and profiles (IIS Express, Kestrel, etc.) used to run the project locally using Visual Studio.
-Contains multiple launch profiles, like:
IIS Express
Kestrel server
Environment variables

📦 Real-life Analogy:
This is your startup script or checklist — tells your app which server to start, on which port, and under what configuration.
 Example snippet:

{
  "profiles": {
    "MyApp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
This tells Visual Studio:
Start app using local Kestrel server
Use ports 5000 (HTTP) and 5001 (HTTPS)
Set environment as "Development"

🛠️ Real-life analogy:
Like setting up environment profiles in your phone: home Wi-Fi vs office Wi-Fi. It sets up how your app behaves in different environments (dev, staging, production).

🔷5 appsettings.json
-This is a configuration file where we can define key-value pairs for settings used throughout our application. 
-. It typically includes connection strings, logging configurations, API keys, or any other application-level configuration
-Connection string means, Database connection string
-Centralized file for configuration settings.
Stores:
Database connection strings
API keys
Logging levels
Feature flags

🛠️ Real-life analogy:
Like a .env file or a central settings book for your app.

📦 Real-life Analogy:
Think of it as your home automation settings panel. You configure lighting schedule, alarm sensitivity, thermostat settings – all in one place.

Example:
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=AppDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}

You can access these in code using:

var connStr = Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");



🔷6. Program.cs
-this is the main file of your appljucation form where the application strats
-The entry point of the app (contains the Main() method).
-Creates and configures the web host.
-In .NET 6+, this file also replaces Startup.cs with the Minimal API model.
-This file configures the web server (Kestrel or IIS) and the necessary middleware components that handle requests.

-this file is The actual entry point of your ASP.NET Core app. Contains:
Main method
Web host builder
Middleware pipeline config

🛠️ Real-life analogy:
It's like the ignition key of a car — once you turn it on, the engine starts, systems initialize, and the car is ready to drive.

📦 Real-life Analogy:
Think of it as the main switchboard operator — it turns on all circuits and directs what happens when a request comes.

🧪 Example (.NET 6+ Minimal API):

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello ASP.NET Core!");
app.Run();



🔷 7. wwwroot/
Default public folder for static files like:
CSS
JS
Images
Fonts

📦 Real-life Analogy:
Like a public bulletin board in a school or office – anything posted there is visible to everyone.


 Example:
Place a file wwwroot/images/logo.png
Access in browser via: https://localhost:5001/images/logo.png

-----------PROJECT TEMPLATES IN ASP .NET CORE-------------

✅1. ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)
-uh can werite the C# and HTML code within the same file, allowing uh to write logic + UI
Uses Razor Pages, a page-based model to build web UIs.
Code (C#) and HTML are in the same .cshtml file.
Each page is self-contained (logic + UI together).
💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of this as a diary, where each page (Razor Page) has its own story (HTML) and notes (C# code-behind).

Code Example:Pages/Index.cshtml
@page
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello from Razor Page!</p>

Pages/Index.cshtml.cs
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet() { }
}


📌 Use Case:
Small to medium web apps (like blogs, company websites).


✅2. ASP.NET Core Empty
The bare minimum ASP.NET Core project.
No folders, no views, no controllers—just Program.cs.

 Real-Life Analogy:
Like an empty plot of land—you can build whatever you want without predefined layout.

📌 Use Case:
For full control over structure.
Great for learning internals or building custom pipelines.

✅3. ASP.NET Core Web API
Designed for building RESTful APIs.
-It includes predefined folders and files for creating and managing API endpoints and is configured with the necessary middleware for building Web APIs.
-Preconfigured for API routing and JSON responses.
-💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a restaurant kitchen, where clients (apps) send orders (HTTP requests) and get food (data responses).

👨‍💻 Code Example:
File: Controllers/ProductController.cs
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<string> Get() => new[] { "Apple", "Banana" };
}


📌 Use Case:
Backend for web/mobile apps.
When you want to send/receive data over HTTP (like JSON).


✅ 4. ASP.NET Core Web API (Native)

Similar to Web API, but optimized for native platform integration.
Uses modern .NET features for better performance on native OS.

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a custom-built machine tailored to work best in your factory setup.
📌 Use Case:
When you need native platform performance (e.g., IoT, mobile backends, containers).

✅ 5. ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller - MVC)

Uses MVC architecture:
Model = data
View = UI
Controller = logic
Separation of concerns: logic, UI, and data are separate.
💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a theatre play:
Controller = Director
Model = Script
View = Stage (presentation)


✅ 6. Blazor Server App
Build interactive UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
Runs on server, sends updates to browser using SignalR (real-time connection).

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a remote control car—you press buttons (UI) on the controller (browser), but the real logic happens on the server.

📌 Use Case:
Real-time dashboards, admin panels, internal apps with fast network.


✅7. Blazor WebAssembly App	
Runs entirely in the browser via WebAssembly.		
All C# and .NET code is downloaded and executed client-side.
💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a portable stove—everything you need to cook (UI logic) is carried with you and works without connection to the server.


✅ 8. Razor Class Library
Create reusable UI components using Razor.

Can be shared across multiple ASP.NET projects.

💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Like a box of Lego bricks—build once, reuse in different models (apps).




🧠 Summary Table:
Template	Ideal For	Analogy
Razor Pages	Simple web UI	Diary with stories

Blazor Server	Real-time UIs (server logic)	Remote control car
Blazor WebAssembly	SPAs (client-side logic)	Portable stove
Razor Class Library	Shared UI components	Lego brick box


-----------PROJECT FILE ---------------
-When uh create a project in Asp .net, It creates a project file with the .csproj extension, and this file includes some settings related to ur project which uh can edit.

PRJECT FILE INCLUDES :

<Project Sdk = "Mircosoft.net.Sdk.Web">
	<propertyGroup>
		<TargetFramework>net8.0</Targetframwwork>
		<Nullable>enalbe</Nullable>
		<ImplicitUsings>enalbe</ImplicitUsings>
	</PropertyGroup>
</Project>

-The .csproj file is an XML file that contains information about your project, such as its dependencies, build configuration, target framework etc.


🗂️ What is a .csproj file?
A .csproj file is an XML file that defines the project configuration in a .NET application. It tells the compiler:
What type of project it is
What SDK to use
What framework version to target
What settings and features should be enabled

Think of it like a "recipe card" that explains how to prepare and build your application.


✅ <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
-it tells the compiler which SDK in the project to use.
-We are using “Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web”, which means it is an ASP.NET Core project with web-specific configurations and dependencies.
-Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web SDK provides tools and libraries required to build, devlop and run ASP .net core web apps
-This tells .NET to use the Web SDK, which is tailored for ASP.NET Core web applications.
It includes:
Web server functionality
Middleware support
Razor/MVC features
Static file handling, etc.

💡 Real-life Analogy:
It’s like choosing a car model for a specific purpose. For racing, you choose a sports car. For building a website, you choose Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web.

If you were building a class library (not a web app), you might use:
EG <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">


✅ <PropertyGroup> ... </PropertyGroup>
This section groups settings and configurations for the project.
You can have multiple PropertyGroup blocks, but most simple projects use just one.
- Properties within this group define aspects like the target framework, nullable reference type handling, and implicit using

💡 Real-life Analogy:
It’s like a settings panel where you turn features ON or OFF.

✅ <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
Tells the compiler which version of .NET to use.

Here, it's targeting .NET 8.0 (the latest LTS as of 2024–25).

This ensures your app uses the correct APIs and runtime behavior from that version

💡 Real-life Analogy:
Choosing a language level or tool version—like learning C# 8 instead of C# 6 because it has more features.


✅ <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
Turns on nullable reference types, a safety feature in C# 8+.
-This feature was introduced in C# 8.0 and helps prevent null reference exceptions by making reference types (like a string, class, etc.) either explicitly nullable or non-nullable. 
-The compiler will give warnings if a potentially null value is not handled properly.
It makes code safer and more resilient to null-related runtime errors 

EG : Code Comparison:
Without <Nullable>enable</Nullable>:
string name = null; // No warning

With <Nullable>enable</Nullable>:
string name = null; // ⚠️ Compiler warning: Possible null assignment

You need to declare it like:
string? name = null; // ✅ Explicitly allows null

✅ <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
Automatically includes commonly used namespaces in your files.
-automatically includes commonly used using directives (e.g., System, System.Collections.Generic, System.Linq, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http, etc.) without explicitly adding them to every file.
Reduces the need to write:
