--------------------ASP.NET Core Web Application SETUP-----------------------


📁 Project Structure Explanation (with Real-Life Analogy)
File/Folder		Description								Real-Life Analogy
Connected Services/	Used to connect your app with external services like Azure, APIs, etc.	Like setting up external suppliers for your shop
Dependencies/		Contains libraries/packages your project needs to run			Ingredients or tools your shop needs to operate
Properties/		Stores project settings like how to launch your app			Instruction sheet for opening/closing the shop
appsettings.json	Central configuration file for settings like DB, logging, etc.		Your shop’s handbook (hours, contacts, policies)
Program.cs		The entry point — starts the app, builds host, routes, services		The main switch that opens your shop in the morning

📁 Connected Services/
What it is: Helps you connect to services like:
Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database
External Web APIs, authentication providers, etc.
Currently empty in new projects unless you add services via Visual Studio.
Real-Life Analogy:
Think of your app like a shop. If you want to sell online, you'll connect to shipping services (FedEx) or payment gateways (PayPal). Connected Services is the section where you manage these external "partners."


📁 Dependencies/
What it includes:
NuGet packages (like libraries/tools)
Framework references (Microsoft.AspNetCore.App, etc.)
Project references (if you have multiple projects)
Example:
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="7.0.0" />
Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you’re running a coffee shop. You depend on tools like espresso machines, milk frothers, etc. These dependencies are tools or supplies without which your shop (app) can’t function.


📁 Properties/ ➤ launchSettings.json
Purpose: Defines how the app should start in different environments (Development, Production, etc.)
Includes settings like:
Launch browser?
Environment variables?
Ports to run on?
Sample:
"profiles": {
  "MyApp": {
    "commandName": "Project",
    "launchBrowser": true,
    "environmentVariables": {
      "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
    },
    "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:5001"
  }
}



📄 appsettings.json
Main config file for:
Logging settings
Connection strings : for connecting to database
Custom settings (e.g., pagination, API keys)
EG :
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=ShopDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning"
    }
  }
}


📄 Program.cs
This is the entry point of the ASP.NET Core app.
Contains:
Main() method
Calls CreateHostBuilder() → sets up web server
Adds services to DI container
Configures middleware (routing, authentication)
EG :
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();

🔁 How They All Work Together
Let’s tie it together with the Coffee Shop Analogy:
Program.cs → The manager starting the day (bootstraps and opens the shop)
appsettings.json → The store’s handbook (defines rules, hours, resources)
launchSettings.json → The checklist for morning setup based on whether it's a weekday (Dev) or weekend (Prod)
Dependencies → The coffee machines, cups, ingredients (external tools/libraries)
Connected Services → Partnerships with delivery services or payment gateways




🧰 Explanation of Common Templates in ASP.NET Core
Template				Use Case
Empty					Minimal, customizable
Web App (Razor Pages)			Page-focused apps with server-side rendering
Web App (MVC)				Layered architecture: Model-View-Controller
Web API					RESTful services
Web API (Native)			Optimized for native platforms
Blazor Server				C# UI apps running on server
Blazor WebAssembly			C# SPA apps running in browser using WebAssembly
