✅HISTORY ASP .NET

Version			    FEATURES

1)ASP(Active server Pages): it was a scripting side technology that allowed developers to create dynacmic web pages, by allowing to embedding server side code(usllly written in Vb Script or jScript within HTML pages). 
RELEASE IN 1990s

2)ASP .net 1.0 : It was a object oriented approach for developing of web development was introduces, Which allows devlopers to use OOP languages like C# for devlopoing web appplicaiton.
-Aslo WEB FROMS technology was introduces, In which we can make web application by drag and drop system. using a UI centric model (DRAG AND DROP) uh can make the website, this was the main freature.
RELEASED IN 2002 with .net Freamwerok.

3)ASP .Net 2.0 :it include the templates for building the pages, like the way we have in Microsoft word. So page layouts were added for uniformity. But only static web app were made.
RELEASED IN 2005.

4)ASP .NET 3.5 :it include features like LINQ(for using the Database) and also supported AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) Which very imp for having a Interactive web application, which would req the pages based on the user inputs. This started the dynacmic web applications building. 
RELEASE : Nov 2007

5)ASP .net 4.0 : it includes features such as URL rounting, Dynamic data and ability to config web.confiig setting using the new configSource attribute.
-APRIL 2010.

6)ASP .Net 4.5 : it includes many new features alsong with APS .net MVC freamwork , and WEB API for building RESTful Services
-It include features like Web sockets and many more.
-MVC was introduced in this 4.5 VERSION.
RELAESD : 2021 aug

7)ASP.Net Core/ ASP .net 5.0/ only ASP .net : All the names are same becoz the Version 5 which was relaesd in 2016 was unified version and flatform independent.
-it is having the cross platfrom ability , which allowed to work with diff software application and on any os this was the Main new feature.
-Modern web development practice was introduced in this verison
-RELEASED : 2016 June.

8)ASP .NET core 6: it was released in nov 2021 


✅FIRST ASP .NET Core PROJECT STRUTURE :
STEPS :
1) Create a ASP .net Core EMPTY project 
2) keep the project and the solution name as same
3) CHoose the freamwrok version 
4) Selecet the "Configiure https"
5) Check the "Do not use top level statements", it will show which class , which namespace uh are working in the program.cs file which is the main entry point


-PROJECT STRUTCURE :
1) Project Name : it will give uh wethere to enable nullable or not, this means that when uh work with the elemenst where there are null values, So how to handle those null values , this will be handled by the CLR automatically if uh enable nullable.
-IMPLICITING USING : This also should be enable, It means that if want to create any user defined implicit fucntions for that , uh need to enable this and auto inteligy will work very good for this.
<PropertyGroup> : These are the html like tags 

2)Program.cs File : If uh uncheck the check box in the additional details, Then the class name and the namespace will be hidden.
-main function will be there, this is where the application will be starting 
-WebApplication.CreateBuilder() : this function will build the web application. This is  building the app 
-app.MapGet() : By this ur creating the default rout and what kind information to display on the main page of ur application. Uh can print any text, JSON, Even render HTML pages in Razox format. This is what is the infroamtion to be build.
-app.Run() : This function will run the app. 
These are the 3 diff sections which re handled in this main Program.cs File .


HOW TO DOWNLOAD PACKAGES :
go to tools-> nuget package manager -> manage package for solution -> install whichever package uh want -> newtonsoft.JSON package -> install
-This package will get install in your current working project only, it wont get globally installed 

3) DEPENDENCIES: the packages uh install will be seen in the dependency project of ur project structure
-If uh want to uninstall the package then uh can also delete the package file from this Dependecy folder.
-another way is go back to nuget tools and tehre uh will see the package in the install menu, and uh can uninstall it from there.

------------------MAIN METHOD OF ASP .NET core-------------------------------

✅ RUNNING THE PROJECT :Just go to the grren btn as we run the Console application, Same uh can run the web application, Even uh can choose the browser, It web site will be running on any of the available port
-Uh will get the msg which uh have set on the deafalut route in the app.MapGet() function.

app.MapGet() : this the Get route on the specified route, Which will render the msg uh have set.


--------------In PROCESS HOSTING FOR ASP .NET CORE----------------

✅IN PROCESS HOSTING (IIS EXPRESS SERVER)

-"IN PROCESS" It means that setting up a internal server rather then depending on some external (third party server) server, which will take time in coordinating and connecting, visual studio itself has a server and even uh can configure it and use it.
-Uh can configure the internal sever using 2 types :
-By default visual studio will have inprocess selected (menas internal server selected), but its not displayed until we use sertain code inorder to display the server information in the google chrome (Right click and see the server modification).
-so uh can set the IIS(in process server).
-Use the "<AspNetCoreHostingModel>"  tag and inside this mention "InProcess", in the project file where uh will eneble the nullable
-This is one way of creating InProcess connection
-another way is by going in the solution explroler -
 properties -> Debug -> IIS express -> Hosting Model -> InProcess
-This is the another way to set the Inprocess sevrer.

-Uh can see the server by inspecting in the Chrome browser.
Go to Netwrok tab -> localhost -> headers tasb ->ResposnseHeaders -> it will display the "Microsft IIS server".

Even  if uh dont set the INPROCESS, By default also it will be ISS. So this is the internal server

ADVANTAGE OF INTERNAL SERVER :
It will be fast if uh use internal server, becoz external sever will require time to fetch the data.
-So by default we will use "IIS EXPRESS"  internal server

🌐 What is IIS Express?
✅IIS EXPRESS SERVER :IIS Express (Internet Information Services Express) is a lightweight, free, and self-contained version of the full IIS web server designed for developers.
It is used during development to run and test ASP.NET applications on your local machine.
Provided by Microsoft.
Installed automatically with Visual Studio.


🏗️ Real-life Analogy:
Imagine you're a chef testing recipes in your home kitchen before launching them in a full restaurant (production).
Your home kitchen = IIS Express (simple, local, fast for testing)
The real restaurant kitchen = IIS (full) (production-grade, heavy-duty, for public use)


🔹 What Does IIS Express Do?
Hosts your web application locally during development.
Simulates how your site would behave on a real server (like IIS on a production machine).
Supports most IIS features: authentication, SSL, custom error pages, etc.
Automatically starts when you run a web app in Visual Studio.


🔹 Why Do We Need IIS Express?
To test web apps locally in an environment similar to a production server.
It’s easy to configure and fast to start — no admin permissions needed.
No setup required — comes with Visual Studio.
Helps debug your application easily.


🔹 What is a Server (in Web Development)?
A server is a computer (or software) that listens for incoming requests and sends back responses.
In web development:
Client = Browser (like Chrome)
Server = Software that responds to browser requests (like IIS, Kestrel, Apache) 	
🔁 When you visit a website:
The browser sends a request (e.g., GET /index.html)
The server processes the request, runs the app/code (e.g., ASP.NET)
The server returns a response, such as an HTML page or JSON data



🔷 What is IIS (Internet Information Services)?
IIS is a web server developed by Microsoft to host and serve web applications, websites, and services. It runs on Windows OS and supports multiple web technologies like:
ASP.NET / ASP.NET Core
PHP
HTML/CSS/JS static sites
WCF Services
REST APIs, and more.


🔷 What Does a Web Server Do?
Imagine a web server like a waiter in a restaurant:
You (the client) ask for a menu item (a webpage).
The waiter (web server) takes your request to the kitchen (the application).
Then returns the dish (the HTML page or API data) back to you.
So, IIS is that waiter, but for web browsers.



🔸 What Does This Line Mean?
"IIS Express is a lightweight, self-contained version of the full IIS (web server) provided by Microsoft."
Let’s break it down:
Phrase	Explanation
"lightweight"	IIS Express is smaller in size and uses fewer system resources than full IIS.
"self-contained"	It runs without needing to install or configure full IIS. Everything needed is bundled with it.
"version of the full IIS"	IIS Express is based on the full IIS, so it works similarly but is optimized for development.
"provided by Microsoft"	IIS and IIS Express are official Microsoft products, deeply integrated into the Windows ecosystem.


📌 Summary:
IIS (Internet Information Services) is a powerful web server used in production environments.
IIS Express is a developer-friendly, simplified version for local development.
Both can host and serve websites, APIs, and services.
IIS Express helps developers test locally without the complexity of full IIS setup.

🔷 IIS vs Apache vs Kestrel
Feature	IIS	Apache	Kestrel (ASP.NET Core)
Developer	Microsoft	Apache Foundation	Microsoft
Platform	Windows only (mostly)	Cross-platform	Cross-platform (Windows/Linux)
Used For	ASP.NET, PHP, Static Sites	PHP, Python, Static Sites	ASP.NET Core only
UI Management	GUI via IIS Manager	Text-based config files	No GUI, code/config only
Best Use Case	Enterprise, ASP.NET hosting	Linux servers, WordPress	High-performance .NET apps
Reverse Proxy Needed?	No (built-in features)	Sometimes (mod_proxy)	Yes (in production: use Nginx/IIS/Apache as reverse proxy)
Extensibility	Modules (.NET & native)	Modules (open-source)	Middleware (via C# code)



🧠 Summary
IIS is a full-featured, secure web server tightly integrated with Windows.	
It processes incoming HTTP requests, loads your app, and returns a response.
IIS Express mimics this flow but is used for local development only.
Kestrel is lightweight and fast but should be used behind a reverse proxy in production.
Apache is more common in Linux environments.
