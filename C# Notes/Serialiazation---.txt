SERIALIZATION 
-Serialization in C# is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored (in a file, database, memory) or transmitted (over a network, API, etc.). 
-Serialization in C# is like saving an object so you can use it later or send it somewhere else.
-It converts an object into a format (like JSON, XML, or binary) that can be stored in a file, database, or sent over the internet.
- Deserialization is the process of getting the object back from the saved format.
-In short Seralization means converting your object(refrence type)into a type that can be stored in file or somewhere, for network transmission.
-Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the stored format back into an object.
-Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the reverse process, converting the stored format back into an object.

-Why Use Serialization?
Serialization is useful in scenarios such as:
Storing objects in databases or files.
Transmitting objects over a network (e.g., web services, APIs).
Caching data for performance improvement.
Saving application state for later retrieval.

-Common Serialization Formats
Binary Serialization – Converts an object into a binary format.
XML Serialization – Converts an object into an XML string.
JSON Serialization – Converts an object into a JSON string (widely used in web APIs).
Custom Serialization – Allows control over the serialization process using attributes or custom methods.

----1)BINARY SERIALIZATION----------

Binary serialization converts an object into a binary format(0 or 1), which is compact and efficient for storage or transmission, uh can store this data into a binary file using the FileStream (File I/O) Class.

EG:
using System;
class Student
{
 public int Id;
 public string Name;
  public Student(int Id, String name)
  {
     this.Id = Id;
     Name = name;
  }
}

class Program
{
   statis void Main()
   {
	Student s = new Student(101, Vishwajeet);
	BinaryFormatter binaryObj = new BinaryFormatter();

 	using (FileStream stream = new FileStream("student.dat", FileMode.Create))
        {
            binaryObj.Serialize(stream, student);
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Student object serialized to binary format.");
        using (FileStream stream = new FileStream("student.dat", FileMode.Open))
        {
            Student deserializedStudent = (Student)formatter.Deserialize(stream);
            Console.WriteLine($"Deserialized Student: ID = {deserializedStudent.Id}, Name = {deserializedStudent.Name}");
        }
   }
}

-BinaryFormatter : this is class which can convert your objects data into binary format
-BinaryFormatter binObj = new BinaryFormatter() : this is a class which is responsible for converting the objects into binary format 
-serialize() : "binObj.Serialize(stream, obj)", this class has one fun as serialize(), which Converts the obj into binary format and writes it to the stream (which is a file in our case). It takes 2 parameter:
	1)stream : it is the file name in which the Binary format of that object will be stored
	2)object : its the object which is going to get converted to binary format
strem: it is the obj of the StreamFile class in which the data will be stored in binary fromat
object: it is the student object which is begin converted to binary fromat.
Deserialize(stream): this(BinaryFormatter) class has another fun which is used for DeSerializing the objcte form binary to its og from, that og from is mention as the type casting in the code "(Student)formatter.Deserialize(stream)".

----2) XML Serialization ----------

-XML Serialization : is the process of converting an object into an XML format so that it can be easily stored, transmitted, and read across different platforms. It is commonly used in web services, configuration files, and data exchange between applications.

-Key Points About XML Serialization in C#
It converts public properties and fields of an object into an XML format.
It does not serialize private fields or methods.
The System.Xml.Serialization namespace provides the XmlSerializer class to perform XML serialization and deserialization.
XML serialization is useful for storing configuration settings, data exchange in web services (SOAP, REST), and persisting object states.

EG:
using System;
[XmlRoot("StudentDetails")] //The Student class will be named as StudentDetails, XMLRoot is the class name 
public class Student
{
   [XmlAttribute("ID")] //The StudentId attribute will be named as ID in the XML format
   public int StudentId{get;set;}
   public string Fname{get;set;} //we have not set this attribute, so its name will be Fname only in the XML file
   public Student(int id, string n)
   {
	Fname=n;
	StudentId = id;
   }
   
}
class Program
{
     static void SerializeToXml(Student student, string filePath)
    {
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Student));//XmlSeralizer is a class which will serialize the object into xml format

        using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(filePath))
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, student);
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Serialization Successful! XML file created.");
    }

    // Method to deserialize an XML file back into an object
    static Student DeserializeFromXml(string filePath)
    {
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Student)); //

        using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
        {
            return (Student)serializer.Deserialize(reader);
        }
    }
   static void Main()
   {
     	string filePath = "student.xml";

        // Create a Student object
        Student student = new Student(1, "John Doe");
      
 	SerializeToXml(student, filePath);

        // Deserialize the XML file back into an object
        Student deserializedStudent = DeserializeFromXml(filePath);

        // Display the deserialized object
        Console.WriteLine("Deserialization Successful!");
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {deserializedStudent.StudentId}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {deserializedStudent.Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Age: {deserializedStudent.Age}");	
   }
}

-XmlSerializer : its a class which is used for converting the objects into XML format, uh need to make a object of this class and send the Typeof(object) in the constructor while making the constructor of this class(typeof(Student)) 
-Serialize(writer, student) : Serialize is the function of the class, which will take the file and the object as the parameter which is to be converted into XML, The Xml data will be stored in the file which uh will create using the file class, 
writer: it is the WriterFile class object, which is send as the parameter to the serialize function
student : its the object which need to be converted into the XML format and saved in the file object 

Deserialize : it is the function which take the file object and reads the XML data and returns it as the object
eg:return (Student)serializer.Deserialize(reader); this will return the student object.


------3)JSON SERIAIZATION-------
-JSON Serialization is the process of converting C# objects into JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight and human-readable data format widely used for web APIs, configuration files, and data exchange.

-Key Points About JSON Serialization in C#
Converts objects into JSON format.
Used extensively in RESTful APIs, web services, and data exchange.
The .NET ecosystem provides two main libraries for JSON serialization:
System.Text.Json (Recommended in .NET Core and .NET 5+)
Newtonsoft.Json (Popular third-party library)

EG:
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public class Student
{
    [JsonPropertyName("id")]
    public int StudentId { get; set; }

    [JsonPropertyName("full_name")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [JsonPropertyName("age")]
    public int Age { get; set; }

    [JsonIgnore] // This property won't be serialized
    public string Password { get; set; }

    public Student() { } // Required for deserialization

    public Student(int id, string name, int age, string password)
    {
        StudentId = id;
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
        Password = password;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string filePath = "student.json";

        // Create a Student object
        Student student = new Student(1, "John Doe", 22, "secure123");

        // Serialize object to JSON and save it
        string jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(student, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
        File.WriteAllText(filePath, jsonString);
        Console.WriteLine("Serialization Successful! JSON file created.");

        // Read JSON file and deserialize it back into an object
        string jsonFromFile = File.ReadAllText(filePath);
        Student deserializedStudent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Student>(jsonFromFile);

        // Display the deserialized object
        Console.WriteLine("Deserialization Successful!");
        Console.WriteLine($"ID: {deserializedStudent.StudentId}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {deserializedStudent.Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Age: {deserializedStudent.Age}");
    }
}



JsonSerializer :it is a static class in the System.Text.Json namespace which is used for converting the object into Json Format.
This class has many Static functions like Serialize and deserialize, which are used for converting the objects into the json format and storeing them into files

-JsonSerializer.Serialize(student, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true }); : this will return uh a JSON string, which uh need to sore in a file.

JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Student>(jsonFromFile);: this static fun returns uh the Sudent class object, from the JSON which uh have passed as "jsonfromFile", This is the Json data taken out from the file using read file operations.

-------SERIALIZATION ATTRIBUTE-----
-Using this Serialization Attributes, uh can control what felids of the class can be serializaed and what felids should not be serialized.

Key Serialization Attributes
1️⃣ [Serializable]
Marks a class as serializable (used for Binary and SOAP serialization).
Required for BinaryFormatter.
Does NOT support selective property exclusion (use [NonSerialized] for that).

2️⃣ [NonSerialized]
Used with [Serializable] to prevent serialization of specific fields.
Works only on fields, not properties.

3️⃣ [DataContract]
Used for WCF services or custom serialization.
Specifies that a class can be serialized

4️⃣ [DataMember]
Used with [DataContract].
Specifies which properties/fields should be serialized.

EG: [DataContract], [IgnoreDataMember] can be used for customSerialization

[Serializable] // Marks class as serializable
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [NonSerialized] // Prevents serialization of sensitive data
    public string Password;

    public Student(int id, string name, string password)
    {
        Id = id;
        Name = name;
        Password = password;
    }
}

EG2:
[DataContract] // Marks the class for custom serialization
public class Employee
{
    [DataMember] // Includes in serialization
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [IgnoreDataMember] // Excludes from serialization
    public string SSN { get; set; }

    public Employee(int id, string name, string ssn)
    {
        EmployeeId = id;
        Name = name;
        SSN = ssn;
    }
}
