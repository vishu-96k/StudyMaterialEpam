STRING VS STRIGBUFFER 

STRING :
-String are Immutable.
-Once uh decalare a string, Uh cannot modify the data in it.
-Uh cannot change the Varibale of string, Uh will always get a new string when uh apply functions on that Exixting string, it wont get modified.
-When we do concatenation, substring, this all returns a new string
-Uh cannot do modification on string.

EG:
string str = "Hello";//memory will be given to str in heap
string str2 = str + "World";//New memory location will be given in heap for this and this returns a new string

-Strings are getting store in Heap memory becoz string is a refrence type and is defined inside the Class String
-Value types are defined in Structure eg int in INTERGER struct
-when uh don't want to do any modification on string, and use string for static values then go for string, which requires few modifications, Then use string


STRING BUILDER CLASS :
-StringBuilder is Mutable.
-means uh can do modification to StringBuilder data, it wont return uh a new string.
-In StringBuilder, Uh can do Modifications
