--EXTENSIONS METHOD--
-This is a new feature that has been added in C# 3.0
-Inheritance is one meachanism using which we can extend the functionalities of the class.
-But when the class is sealed class, then we cannot apply inheritance on sealed class.
-We cannot apply inheritance on structure 	
-if we want to extend the functionality of a structure not a classs then also we cannot do inheritance. If the original tyope is not a class, its a structure.
-so if it is a sealed class or a structure then we cannot extend the functionality of that class or structure.
-If we extend the functionality of a class using inheritance then also we can call the extendent methods only by using the object of the child class not by the object of the parent class.
-So we have extensions MEthods
