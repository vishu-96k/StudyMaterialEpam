---LINQ--2--WinForms--
Uh can Create a Winform application, which is using LINQ for data Modiications

---------CHATGPT steps------------:
 Step 1: Create Database & Table (SQL Server)
Create PracticeCompanyDB database and Employee table in SQL Server.
Insert some sample data into the Employee table.


 Step 2: Create WinForms Project
Open Visual Studio.
Create a new Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project.
Name the project: WinFrom1001.

Step 3: Connect to Database (Add .edmx File)
Add ADO.NET Entity Data Model:
Right-click your project > Add > New Item > ADO.NET Entity Data Model.
Name it: PracticeCompanyModel.edmx.
Click Add.
Choose Model Contents:
Select EF Designer from Database.
Setup Connection:
Choose your SQL Server connection (PracticeCompanyDB).
Select Database Objects:
Check the Employee table.
Click Finish.


 Step 4: Check Generated Files
In Solution Explorer:
PracticeCompanyModel.edmx should have:
PracticeCompanyModel.Context.tt (Contains PracticeCompanyDBEntities).
PracticeCompanyModel.tt (Contains Employee.cs).


Step 5: Design Form2 (UI Elements)
Add Label (For displaying employee details).
Add Button controls: btnPrevious, btnNext, btnClose.
Set the Form2 name properly in the Designer.

 Step 6: Set Startup Form
Open Program.cs and change Application.Run(new Form1()); to Application.Run(new Form2());.

Step 7: Write Code for Data Display & Navigation
Load Employee data from PracticeCompanyDB using Entity Framework.
Implement logic for Previous, Next, and Close buttons.

 Step 8: Connect UI Controls to Events
Add click events for buttons (btnPrevious, btnNext, btnClose).
Display data in the Label control.
btnPrevious.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.btnPrevious_Click);
btnNext.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.btnNext_Click);
btnClose.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.btnClose_Click);



 Step 9: Build & Run the Application
Press F5 or click Start in Visual Studio.
Test the application for proper navigation and data display.


-----------OWN-----STEPS----------------
1)add ADO .ent Entity Data Model 
	Select --Ef designer --Connection string :Make new connection -->Select Tables-->Finish
-This will create The ORM of your data base and the classes and the properties will be generated. For eg uh have employee table and its entities(colums), so Employee class and cloumns will be the class properties will be generated.

2)Create the from.cs file and add the code in that to display the data from table into the form using eventHandalers and the Lables and text boxes

-new PracticeCompanyDBEntities() is creating an instance of the PracticeCompanyDBEntities class, which is a DbContext class that represents the connection between your application and the SQL Server database (PracticeCompanyDB).
-DbContext files helps in the connection betweeb SQL and the Application by passing the connection string as the parameter internally .
-PracticeCompanyDBEntities class is typically generated by Entity Framework when you create your model using Database-First or Model-First approaches.

-Dbset<T> :is a class in Entity Framework that represents a collection of all entities in a table or view in the database. It acts as a bridge between your application code and the actual data stored in the database.

DbSet is a generic class defined as:
SYNTAX:
	public class DbSet<TEntity> where TEntity is class(basically tables of our database)

	Tentity : it is a class, which is made by ORM so basically it wil be the table name from the database 
	entity = table 



OBJECT OF DBCONTEXT CLASS (context):
var context = new PracticeCompanyDBEntities()):
-It creates an instance of the PracticeCompanyDBEntities class, which is your DbContext class. This instance (context) is responsible for managing the connection to your database (PracticeCompanyDB) and interacting with its tables.
-The context(object) tracks any changes you make to the entities (Employee objects) fetched from the database.
-Ensuring Proper Disposal (using Statement):
The using block ensures that the context is disposed of properly once the operation is done.
Disposing releases all resources, closes the database connection, and ensures data integrity.
-This context obj chave many properties and functions, like uh can access your table directly and do CURD opration on that table
-KEY FEATURES OF CONTEXT OBJECT
1)CRUD Operations:
Uses Add(), Find(), Remove(), SaveChanges() for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
	EG:
	1. Retrieving Data (Read)
	var context = new PracticeDompanyDBENtities() //DBcontext class
	var employees = context.Employees.ToList(); // Retrieves all employees from the Employee table into list
	var singleEmployee = context.Employees.Find(101); // Retrieves an employee by primary key (Eno = 101)

	2. Adding Data (Create)

	var newEmployee = new Employee
	{
    	Eno = 106,
    	Ename = "Sarah",
    	Job = "Manager",
    	Salary = 80000,
    	Dname = "Sales"
	};
	context.Employees.Add(newEmployee);
	context.SaveChanges(); // Commits the new row to the database

 	3.Updating Data (Update)

	var employee = context.Employees.Find(106);
	if (employee != null)
	{
    		employee.Salary = 85000; // Modify data
    		context.SaveChanges(); // Save the changes to the database
	}



	4. Deleting Data (Delete)

	var employee = context.Employees.Find(106);
	if (employee != null)
	{
    		context.Employees.Remove(employee);
     		context.SaveChanges(); // Removes the record from the database
	}

	5. Executing Raw SQL Queries (Advanced)
	var highPaidEmployees = context.Employees.SqlQuery("SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 50000").ToList();

Write all this code in the from.cs file which will be generated once uh add a From  

3)Run the from in the program.cs file in the main program to see the outputs
