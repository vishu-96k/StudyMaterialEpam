-------MVC ------------

MODELS :
-Database schema are defined by code, thts called models

-RightClick on Models --> Add--> Class--> userModel.cs

-add properties as colum names using get set and also add attributes(which act as a client side validation)

-attributes act as a constriants

- uh have to give the foreign keys also in the models, becoz that's the different Table 

-One model is one TABLE

-Add a Model file ac class.cs only as ApplicationDBContext.cs

-ApplicationDBContext.cs : In this file there are database connection is there 
	[public Dbset<User> Users] // •	This makes the table in the database. DbSet<> is a class that takes the entity (Table) as a type and creates the table (  Users  table : if uh pass the user in the<user>) in the database, basically pass the Models which uh have made.
	- it is most imp file, becoz the database creation, connections things are in this file only, like it will take the database name form the connection string and the Id also.
	-It is the most important file, because database creation and connection handling are in this file.
  	-It takes the database name from the connection string and handles the ID as well.


-OnModelCrreating() : This fun Does the cascading. it is used to configure entity relations like FK and PK constraints

Install nuget ---> Install Entity framework

Web.config : in this put the connection string, copy the SQL name and paste it in the Connection string, Db name also 



-------------MIGRATIOON----------------

If uh do any change in your schema then uh need to make a new migration. 

up() : when uh do update-migration then Up() method is exceuted
if uh want to do revert (update-database) then the cmd is update-database -targetMigration: migrationName 

Down() :when uh do revet that time down method is excuted, everything is removed like forign key, table.


 
when the whole databse connection is done, then perform migration
tools --> nuget package manager--> console :
	-Enable-Migrations : it will generate the configuration.cs file in migrations folder. it will just enable the migrations

	-Add-Migration-Name : it will create the migration file for your DB with that name. it will generate a new migration file with name. In this file 
	-Update-migration : last migration will be exceuted 


Configuration.cs : in this the seed method is always excuted when any migration is excuted using update-database  cmd
seed() : add the table creastion tables in this method


-------Controller------
-Now add the controller -->select Model class--> generate views and all 3 -->Add
-Automatically views, layout page will be created
-controller : The link will be from the views name which will be based on the Controller only 
-COntroller.cs : this will include all the actions, it includes Get, post, delete req routes. it also includes bind class
-bind : it binds the usermodel fields with  the obj to store in the database .
-view bag :Data from the controller comes and goes to the Viewbag.

STEPS :
	1)CREATE ALL MODELS
	2)CREATE ApplicationDBContext File
	3)Add your Connection string into the Web.config file
	<connectionStrings>
	<add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Server=EPINHYDW141B; Database=MVCRegistrationDB;Integrated 	Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	</connectionStrings>
 	
	4)Build Solution using ctrn + shift +B
	5)Open the nuget consonle and:
			-Enable-Migrations
			-Add-Migration-Name
			-Update-Database
	6)Create Controller and it will generate views.
		


CHATGPT PROMPT
I want to develop a simple CRUD application using asp.net mvc web forms in.net framework using code first approach, lets implement it step by step; give models and controllers too and the applicationdbcontext too; for user store UserID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Address, gender model, country model and state model, ensure the foreign key relationships, use proper attributes for the properties.

INSTALL :
	Install-Package EntityFramework
