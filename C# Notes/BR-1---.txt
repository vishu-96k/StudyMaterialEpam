✅[#1]Dot NET INTRO 

📌What is Dot Net
-Dot net is a software, or a product of microsoft devloeped for making application.
-So uh used it for devlopging any kinf of application, like desktop() ,  Web() , Console () , mobile () etc, all this uh can make by using Dot et framwork

-TYPES OF APPLICATION :
WEB : ASP, JS, Java
MObile :
Desktop : CPP 

PROBEM WITH OLDER PROGRAMMUING LANGUAGE :
-Languages like c/CPp, java, is that we canot use the same language for devloping all the types of application, we need to use diff lanuage for diff type of application.
EG : For devoping desktop application, we need to use CPP, but these cpp lanuage is not fisible for devloping web application
     For devloping web applciation we reqiuired to take support of JS, or PHP, ASP etc.
     For devloping mobile applicaiton uh need to use some other language like 

So the solution for this problem was Dot Net, becoz as a programmer uh need to learn diffrrent languages for devoping diff types of application.
-So microsoft came up with DotNet, in which uh can built all types of applications, becoz dotNet supports more then 50 languages.
