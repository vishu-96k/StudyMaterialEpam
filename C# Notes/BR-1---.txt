✅[#1]Dot NET INTRO 

📌What is Dot Net
-Dot net is a software, or a product of microsoft devloeped for making application.
-So uh used it for devlopging any kinf of application, like desktop() ,  Web() , Console () , mobile () etc, all this uh can make by using Dot et framwork

-TYPES OF APPLICATION :
WEB : ASP, JS, Java
MObile :
Desktop : CPP 

PROBEM WITH OLDER PROGRAMMUING LANGUAGE :
-Languages like c/CPp, java, is that we canot use the same language for devloping all the types of application, we need to use diff lanuage for diff type of application.
EG : For devoping desktop application, we need to use CPP, but these cpp lanuage is not fisible for devloping web application
     For devloping web applciation we reqiuired to take support of JS, or PHP, ASP etc.
     For devloping mobile applicaiton uh need to use some other language like 

-So the solution for this problem was Dot Net, becoz as a programmer uh need to learn diffrrent languages for devoping diff types of application.
-So microsoft came up with DotNet, in which uh can built all types of applications, becoz dotNet supports more then 50 languages.
-So mircrsoft give DotNet a product for devloping various kinds of application. WHich include many languages supports.
-the devolpers who are comming from CPP, are workig with C# languages, becoz syntax is similar.
-If uh come from VB (visual basic language), then dot Net has VB .net.
-Even we have F#, J# languages supported in dot Net.
-So programmer has  choice of langage chossing for devloping the application.
-If uh are from java backrounf choice, J# .net language
-Even though we have many languges, But mostly used langage is C# for devloping .Net Application
-So .net was coppiteter for java.  

📌C# language:
-C ---> CPP ---> C#   //Extension 
CPP: is best used fo devloping desktop application only, But C# is used for devloping any kind of application.
-We have the same advantage with java also, like uh can devlop any kind of appluction wiht java, but the java and .net are 2 diff products of diff companyes, therefore comppitetors.
-Almost 8 to 10 % of the world progammers who are using C# for devloping applicaitons. Most widly used language

-FEATURES OF C# :
oop
Securty and resuibillity
Platform Independent, Uh can run on any OS
Language INDEPNDENT : means language inerpolability, can communicate with other languages also. Like code of C#, can use other code of VB .net in their application.
