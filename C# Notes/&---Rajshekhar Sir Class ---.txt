1) DB First Apporact =>
2) MODEL FIRST APPORACH =>

==============MODEL FIRST APPROACH ===================
first its searching for aspx
then its searching for ascx 
there are two engines aspx and ascx engine, find the difference between aspx and ascx engine

MVC used both the engines

First create Modle : as class , write all the contents of the form in it 


new model add a class file 
Add a new controller --> in this go to CREATE() and add view



============================================================================================================================

CREATE CODE FIRST APPROCAH IN MVC

CHAT GPT PROMPT:
I want to develop a simple CRUD application using asp.net mvc web forms in.net framework using code first approach, lets implement it step by step; give models and controllers too and the applicationdbcontext too; for user store UserID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, Address, gender model, country model and state model, ensure the foreign key relationships, use proper attributes for the properties.
 

copy models from gpt  (models are the DB table schema)
then create applicationdbcontext : in this database connection code is there and it is also a .cs file in models
if there are FK in models, add cascading in the applicationContextDb file which is also a model file (as class)
Install the ENTITY FRAMEWROK PACKAGE FROM THE Nuget(like npm)

Add connection string in web.config :fill from db name Modify the Web.Config fle : add the connection string into the file in which uh need to guve the name of the SQL server 	

Run the code in the NUGET PACKAGE MANAGER CONSOLE :
	Enable migrations 
	Add migrations -name
	Update Database

Add controller (controller takes the data from view and send it to model and handels the bussness logic)
As uh will add the controller then automatically the views will be created which will be the cshtml files means the web pages

Modify the ApplicationDBContext.cs file  : You can modify the Seed method in the Configuration class to add initial data for Gender, Country, and State tables using the AddOrUpdate method.	

Add data to ApplicationContext.cs file

Run the code in the NUGET PACKAGE MANAGER CONSOLE :
	Update Database

And run the

ACTION FILTER

-action filter can only be used when uh create action filter.
MidlleWeres 

======================.Net Framwork====27/03/25===
-we need asp .net core for Building WEb app
-only .net core can only make console app 
-so we need asp .net core for building web apps
-when we use Linux Os it uses Casteral Server, which will forword the req to the IAS (windows) server.
Why is core faster the framework:
-becoz of modular structure, The .netCore is More faster then framework
-in core the libraries are divided into furter more modular libraries becoz of which it is faster then framwrok.
-in framework uh can see that the project is only dependednt on 8 refrences, but in core uh can see that the refrences are more, so each of the libraries are light weight.
-So becoz each libraries is lightweight, its get load faster, thts why core is faster then framework
-Asp .net core is providing the Conteroller,modules (Frontend part), and backend is provided by the core.


CORE :
how does the req travel in core:
-First (port and ip addresss) reach the sserver
-particular controller, particular action is selected.
-using the Atriibute rounting uh can map the url and the routes


=============28/03/2025===========ANGULAR----
ANGULAR : main diff between React and Angular and why is Angular a framowrk and React a library.
stand alone archetecture
Angular : has 2 complication, AOT and JIT see diff between AOT and JIT compiler
Add cisuton director, and make it in Angular (GC question).
Life Cycle hooks in Angular, like we have in React js
