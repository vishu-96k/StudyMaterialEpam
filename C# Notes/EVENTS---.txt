---EVENTS---

Feature					Function (Method)					Event
Definition			A block of code that performs a task			A notifier that triggers subscribed functions
Invocation			Called directly						Cannot be called directly, only raised
Logic				Contains logic						Does not contain logic, only triggers handlers
Subscription			Cannot have multiple subscribers			Supports multiple subscribers (functions)
Usage				Used for calculations, operations, etc.			Used for notifications and event-driven programming

--QUESTIONS--

Here are all the prompts you asked today:

What is the type of an event?--> Delegate
Is an event a function? --> NO
What do publisher and subscriber mean in the whole process of event creation and handling in C#? -> Binding of Fun to event
Hooking up the event in the Main method—does this mean binding the subscriber and publisher? --> YES
TEventArgs must be a class that inherits from EventArgs. What is this EventArgs? Is it a predefined class? --> EVENTARGS is a class
Can we write the body of the event? --> NO, But uh can write logic for custom add and remove methods
What is EventHandler? Is it a class? --> No, eventHandler is a predefined Delegate, And EvenetHandler<T> is a Genric delegate which takes T as EventArgs.


Q1. Differences Between Delegates and Events
Feature						Delegate					Event
Definition			A reference type that holds method references			A wrapper around a delegate that restricts access

Usage				Used to call methods dynamically (callback mechanism)		Used for publish-subscribe communication

Invocation			Can be called (invoked) directly				Can only be invoked inside the declaring class

Encapsulation			No restrictions on invocation from other classes		Can only be subscribed (+=) or unsubscribed (-=) externally

Multiple Subscribers		Supports multiple method references (+=, -=)			Also supports multiple subscribers but cannot be invoked 												externally

Purpose				A function pointer mechanism for calling methods dynamically	Used to signal that an event has occurred

Default 			Storage	No automatic storage mechanism				Stores handlers using the event keyword



Q2)What is a Delegate?
A delegate is a type-safe function pointer that can refer to methods.
It allows methods to be assigned dynamically and invoked later.
EG :using System;

public delegate void MyDelegate(string message); // Declaring a delegate

class Program
{
    static void ShowMessage(string msg) => Console.WriteLine("Message: " + msg);

    static void Main()
    {
        MyDelegate del = ShowMessage; // Assigning a method to a delegate
        del("Hello, Delegates!");     // Calling the method via delegate
    }
}


Q3 . What is an Event?
An event is a special kind of delegate used in the publisher-subscriber model.
Only the declaring class can invoke the event, ensuring better encapsulation.

EG:
using System;

public class EventPublisher
{
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;  // Declare an event

    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Raising an event...");
        MyEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);  // Invoke event if there are subscribers
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        EventPublisher publisher = new EventPublisher();

        // Subscribe to the event
        publisher.MyEvent += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine("Event received!");

        publisher.RaiseEvent(); // Raise the event
    }
}

EG 2 : for a button click
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Button button = new Button { Text = "Click Me" };
        button.Click += (sender, e) => MessageBox.Show("Button Clicked!");
        Application.Run(new Form { Controls = { button } });
    }
}


Q4 .Real Life senarios of delegate and events :
DELEGATES :
Using Delegates for Callbacks (Asynchronous Processing)
📌 Scenario: Background Processing with a Callback
Imagine you have a long-running operation (e.g., downloading a file). You don't want to block the main thread, so you use a delegate as a callback when the task is complete.

Using Delegates for Strategy Pattern
📌 Scenario: Implementing Sorting Strategies
Delegates allow dynamic method selection, useful in sorting algorithms.


EVENTS :
Event-Driven Programming (Button Click Event)
📌 Scenario: Handling UI Button Clicks
GUI frameworks like WinForms or WPF rely on events for handling user interactions.

Observer Pattern Using Events
📌 Scenario: Stock Market Price Change Notification
A stock market application notifies investors when a stock price changes. Investors (subscribers) listen to the stock price changes.


Scenario: Messaging System Using Event Aggregator
When components in a large application need to communicate without direct dependencies, an event aggregator (mediator) can be used.


Use Delegates when you need callbacks or strategy patterns.
Use Events when implementing publish-subscribe patterns or GUI event handling.
