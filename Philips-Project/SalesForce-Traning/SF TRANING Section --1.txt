	professional :this is bit advance, we have more CRM technologies

2) SANDBOX : sales force has 4 sandbox
-Sandbox is a platform where we practice

3) SF ARCHETECTURE : 
-SF has a multi tenant archetecutre and here we will be having multiple customers who will be purchasing and they are doing there things , but these customers will be sharing the same platfrom, same database, and all of this is handle within the same platfrom.
-even though these tenant share the same resouces of salesforce, but without begin impacted on each others tenant, it means, meta data of one company is not shared amoung the another company.
-there will be multiple tenant, and each tenant will be sharing resourses within the archecturre, and these resource sharing will be done in a good way, and even the data is collected and keept and whatever data is of one client will not be shared with the other client. 
uh don't have to write code to store the meta data in the backend, uh just have to click abd thts it

---------------------------PRACTICE------------------------------------------

TRAILHEAD ACCOUNT : go to question mark --> log in to trailhead .
Check the release part, and other optuions
also check switch to salesfoerce classic

SalesForce Classic : it means , in 19999 when SF was lasunched, everyone was working on Classic version
and latest version is the lightning version,  we will be working on lightining version
2015 :they launch the lightning version which is a newer version, and its good, and we use it now

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPS : the 9 dots is called app launcher, and it has many apps, and we will be working on sales app, and this will have many imp tabs, like Leads, Tasks , Accounts.

-------------------------------------TASKS-------------------
USERs:
-users is same as IAM users
-uh can also attach roles, and user licence which will ristrict the user form using the policies, and cotroling the persmissions of the users
Create 10 users so that org people can use it like AWS IAM
After createing user, people can use the Account like IAM user in AWS

STEPS : setting --> setups--> serachfor --> users---> new users --> username, user-email etc --> create user

-----------------------------------------------------------------

PROFILE vs ROLES OF USERs
-uh can attach roles, and profile for a user, which will limit the access of the users, by allowing specific services to it only
PROFILES : This gives uh access to ur SF orgs (like the objects/TABS), which uh seen on the frontend, and if uh dont want to ristrict the user access from some of the tabs/objects, using profile uh can control that 
ROLES : Role is a hiraricy here, like the way we have teams tree hiriracy, and we have our manager, then director above us and at the end CEO.
-So uh can assign roles hirarcy tree structure to the users, like what role does the user have , and even uh can see how many people are there in particular role, like a developer, lead, and At the end CEO of the company.
-Uh can also have ur own tree role structure, like a custom structure

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT MANAGER 
OBJECT 
-is noth but a table in datasbe, uh have 2 types of object, custome or standard
-if the object doest have __c it means it is a standard object, not a custom object
-If object has a Api ending with __c it means its a custom object	

LEAD
-Lead is a object 
-uh need to create a lead, and even Create a FEILD and relationships , and uh need to create a field for ur lead, from the Object manager
-So when uh are working on lead, its like working on the frontend the UI and whenever uh r into setups uh are working in backend like this map it 
-FRONTEND : uh can go to the LEAD tab, and create lead, add feilds, and data to it
-BACKEND : uh can also go to the setups---> lead, and create lead and add some feilds and relationships into the lead object, and this is called a Reacord
-RECORD : when uh add/ create a new lead data, it is called as a record, becoz uh will be creating and adding lead name, lead data into it.
-Uh can create customs feild records from the relationship and feilds wala tab from the setup

STANDARD FEILD 
-in SF is noth but a automatically provided by the SF and if uh want to create something own custom as per needs, it is called Custom fields
from the API name uh can tell the Feild is standard or custom, if it has a __c (API name) it means that its  a Custom feilds

Q) eg: uh have 2 leads, and one of the lead uh want some customs feilds data, and for the other lead uh want some custom fields data, and both the lead wants diff data feilds for their records, so in this case what will uh do?
ANS : here comes the PAGE LAYOUT into pictire.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PAGE LAYOUT  
-is a UI customazition tool which is used to add or remove the page record or layout edition tool for UI for fields
-page layout and record types are for controlling the UI, for customizating the UI
-So if some lead records doesn't want some of the feilds, then uh can customize the feilds of a particular recourds using page layout
-For eg uh have 2 leads, with same record feilds, and for one lead uh dont want to show some specific data feilds then using record types uh can do so, like uh can create ur own record types, which is having the particular feilds for that object to store data and this record will be a custom record and will show whatever uh wanaa show
-using page layout  uh can do this, and uh can add or remove feilds from the pages, by page I mean, records page.
-When uh create a Record type, then while creating a new LEAD record, it will ask uh which record type(data and feilds) should the new reord be off, and based on that it will create a new record and thoese feilds only will be shown.
-FRONTEND : from frontend also uh can edit the UI using the edit page option below the setups, which will open a lighniitng app builder, which shoes which feild to show and which not to show. 
-CHATTER :using this chatter option from the app builder uh can add and filter some feilds and customize the records. 
EG : uh can also set a feild, like if ur city is Hyderabad then only that city feild will be shown, something like this can be controlled using chatter which is present in the edit--> lighting app builder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
REPORTS :
-just to understand how many leads were created and how many contact where their in a given day, basically uh want a report of a particular LEAD record, then uh can use this REPORT object and it will give uh the report of ur lead.
-Uh can create ur own report types from both Frontend as well as backedn (from setup)
-Backend : uh can create a repot type form the setup
-frontend : uh can use that type and create a repot on a particular lead record.
-standard reports : uh can see that there already a report type on the lead object. 
-uh just have to ---> select that lead ---> start report
-even uh can apply filters on  the reports using the filters options

STEPS :
Object manager -->CREATE LEAD--> CREATE RECOrd --> Create FEILDS --> Add/remove the FEILDS using PAGE LAYOUT--> record types


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
