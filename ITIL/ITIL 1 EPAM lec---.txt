✅[#1] ITIL

📌ITIL :

DEFINATION : ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework of best practices for delivering and managing IT services efficiently and effectively.
🔹In Simple Words:
ITIL helps IT teams to manage and deliver services (like fixing computers, running servers, supporting apps) in a structured and professional way, so customers get consistent and reliable support.
EG : support.epam.com

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)ITIL its basically a systematic approach for delivering and providing High quality of IT serices. It helps organizations manage IT service management (ITSM) by aligning IT services with their business needs.

ITSM : basically when we apply the ITIL framework practically it is noth but ITSM
ITSM  :
📦 Definition:
ITSM is the actual implementation and management of IT services based on frameworks like ITIL.
ITIL = Framework, ITSM = Practical implementation of that framework.
Similar framework : Agile Service Management(ASM)
		    MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
		-----NO NEED TO SAY IN INTERVIEW-----

-Busnnesss ensure that their IT services are running soomthly and meeting the needs of the customers, this is done by ITIL framework.
-ITIL is a framework, which help the business to  manage their IT services and help to improve their overall efficiency.
-ITIL = stands for information technology infrastructure library, Which is basically a set of libraries which is used for managing IT services.
-ITIL : are basically best practices use to manage IT Bussness/Services.
-IT Services : it means, Like Issue management process service, 
ITIL provides a framework for businesses to align their IT services with their overall
business needs. 

📌ITIL examples (HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM):
FOR EG :
there is a hospital , and for managing the hospital services there are lot of softwares like hospital management system, now to manage these Software we use the framwwork called ITIL
Here are some key processes included in ITIL

Example of ITIL:
Imagine a hospital uses many software systems like:
Hospital Management System (HMS)
Patient record system
Appointment scheduling
Billing and lab reporting systems
To ensure these software systems are always running smoothly, issues are resolved quickly, and updates/changes are managed properly, the hospital’s IT team follows a framework called ITIL.
-ITIL helps the IT team manage, fix, and improve the hospital’s software services in an organized and efficient way.

Example:
Imagine a company has an IT Help Desk. When your email stops working, you raise a ticket.
Using ITIL:
They log the issue (Incident Management),
Prioritize and assign it,
Fix it, and
Record the solution to help others later (Knowledge Management).

		NO NEED TO SAY TILL HERE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE : support.epam.com
Is support.epam.com an example of ITIL in real life?
Yes, support.epam.com can be considered a real-life implementation of ITIL practices, especially in these areas:
Incident Management: Logging and resolving IT-related issues or support tickets.
Service Desk: Providing a single point of contact for employees or clients.
Knowledge Base: Offering self-service support to reduce ticket load.
Change/Request Management: Handling requests for changes, software access, etc.
It may not be a fully ITIL implementation, but it follows core ITIL concepts in service delivery and support.

One-line Example:
When you contact IT support because your email isn’t working, ITIL helps the team follow clear steps to fix it quickly and properly.


🧩 Real-Life Example of ITIL:
Let’s say a company’s email server goes down — employees can’t send or receive emails.
Using ITIL Incident Management process, the IT team:
Logs the incident in the tool.
Categorizes it as a high-priority issue.
Assigns it to the right support engineer.
Resolves the issue and restores service.
👉 This follows ITIL’s defined steps to handle incidents efficiently.
So companies follow Jira Sevice management or service now,
When the email issue happens, a user raises a ticket in the ITSM tool → it automatically goes to the right support team → progress is tracked → issue is resolved and the ticket is closed.


📌ITIL KEY PROCESS/STEPS :
Here are some key processes included in ITIL :
1) Incident Management process : it deals with restoring normal service operations as quickly as possible when there is an unexpected interruption, it focus on minimizing the impact of incidents on bussness operation.
-In this the following cycle will be there :
New Incident : A new incident will be raise
Catagarization of Incident : then that incident will be catogarized, and  prioritized as per the SLA(its a document "Service level agreement").
ANALYZING : then we need to analyze the issue
Communication : we need to communicate to the end user about how to resolve the issue, Communicate through chat aur any other mediam.
RESOLVE ISSUE : At the end Resolve the issue.
COLSE ISSUE : after resolving close the issue.
-All these are the process included in the incident management

What is an incident?
incident is An unplanned interruption which affacts the service and reduction the service quality.

What are the major steps in Incident Management?
Detection → Logging → Categorization → Prioritization → Escalation → Resolution → Closure

Difference between Incident and Service Request?
Incident = unplanned issue; Request = predefined user request (e.g., password reset).


2) Problem Management process: this process aims to indentify the root cause of the incident(matlab vo issue q aaya hain uska root cause kay hain, what has cause that issue? the real reason behind the issue is identified) and to prevent them from happening again in future. It involvles analyzing patterns and trends to find the internal underlying issue
-main kaam problem management process ka hain root cause find out krna , ki issue q aya hain.

What is a Problem?
The underlying cause of one or more incidents.

Difference between Incident and Problem?
Incident = effect; Problem = cause.

What tools/techniques are used?
RCA (Root Cause Analysis), 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram.


Example of 5 Whys
Problem:
A web application went down.
| Step | Question                              | Answer                                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Why did the web app go down?          | Because the server stopped responding.                      |
| 2️⃣  | Why did the server stop responding?   | Because it ran out of memory.                               |
| 3️⃣  | Why did it run out of memory?         | Because a background process consumed all RAM.              |
| 4️⃣  | Why did the process consume all RAM?  | Because of a memory leak in the new deployment.             |
| 5️⃣  | Why was the memory leak not detected? | Because there was no performance testing before deployment. |

Root Cause: Lack of proper testing before deployment.
Solution: Add performance testing to the CI/CD pipeline.

3) Change Management Process :  Change management is all about controlling the life cycle of all the changes, Changes mtlab: Lets say ek software hainn (swiigy), swiggy software par kuch update aya hain end user ko, tho use vo update marni padegi,   and programmer ko bhi use software main changes krke server pr deploy krne padenge, tho iss process ko bolte hain change management process.
-matlb software ko update kiya, ya kuch bhi change kiya tho use bolenge ki change management process ke andar uska controlling ata hian.
-Change management is all about controlling the life cycle of all the changes, ensuring that benifical changes are made with minmal distruption to IT srvices. it involves assessing, approving, implementing, and reviewing changes systematically.
-Follwing are the steps/ stages involved in this process:
IDENTIFICATION : in this step we need to indentify the change, identifying the Scope, current status , future state, results and concept
PRESENTATION : in this process, information, risk analysing, cost of the change, everythinh uh need to present.
PLANING : uh need to plan the clear steps, analysis, and measurements required.
EVALUATION : identification, data gathering, Funding and resource allocation, action plan, KPI reporting.
COMMUNICATION : Execute, indentify, plan, onboard, management.

Questions:
What is a change in ITIL?
Any addition, modification, or removal that could affect IT services.

What is CAB?
Group that assesses and approves changes.

Example of emergency change?
Hotfix for a critical outage.

4) SERVICE LEVEL AGREMENT MANAGEMENT : this process involves defying, negoatiting , and agreeing on the seevices levels required by the business. it ensures that they agreed upoan leveles of the servicies and that the services delivered are aligned with the business needs and expectations.
-ek service provider hain and uska ek client hian, tho service provideer service dega client ko(eg  TV cable services ), tho services provide ache se hone ke liye kuch contract krenge client and provider, client jo hain uska SLA mention krega(matlab ki agar bhohat he jadha important issue hain tho uska resolution client ko chaiye he chiaye, agar ni kr paya tho provided ko penelty lagegi, matlb legal document agrremtnt ka  )

5) SERVICE DESK: this is the single point of contact between service provider and the client(users), it is responsible for handling all the communication, incidents and service request as well as keeping users informed about the status of their inquires or issues.
-Matlb user se issues lena, user ko update krna ye sare kaam service desk wale karenge 

6) Configuration Management : this process focus on the mainitng information about the configuration items required to deliver an IT serrvie, including their relationships. It helps in understraning the impact of changes and in maintaing accurater infromation about the infrastructure.
-ye ek configuration management process hain, matlb infrastruture ke related service hain, jo sab configurations items jo hote hain unki information gather krke rakhta hian apne pass.

All these process helps organizations to manage their IT services effectivey, ensuring, that they align with the bisioness overall objectives and that any disruptions are minimized.
-MATLB EK WHOLE AND SOLE JO GOAL HAIN VO HIAN BUSSNIESS CHALANA, AND USKE LIYE YE STEPS IMPLIMENT KRNI PADEGI, AND ALL THESE PROCESS MILAKE BOLTE HIAN ITIL.    
   

✅[#2] SLA :

📌What is SLA?
SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a formal agreement between a service provider (like an IT team or vendor) and a customer (a business or user) that defines:
What service will be provided
How fast or reliably it will be delivered
What happens if the service fails
-In simple words, its the legal agreement, between the customer and the service provided about how the things are going to happen between them, and what actions will be taken if the service provider will fail to full fill the promises and the given deadlines for solving the issues.


📌Why SLA Exists?(Service Level Agreement) (The Need)
SLAs help set clear expectations so both the service provider and the customer know:
What is expected
When it's expected
What happens if expectations are not met
This avoids confusion and holds people accountable.
-In simple words, to avoid conflict between the customers and the service provider, if their deal fails, then what will happen, to make aware about all the promises and their need to full fill ment to the end user, we need this agreement.


📌 What Does SLA Do (Service Level Agreement)?
1) Defines performance targets (e.g., response time, uptime) : An SLA sets clear and measurable expectations for service delivery. These targets are agreed upon by both the provider and the client.
Examples:
Uptime Guarantee: “Service will be available 99.9% of the time in a calendar month.”
Response Time: “Support tickets will be acknowledged within 2 hours.”
basically it sets the time period

2) Creates accountability : SLAs hold the service provider accountable for meeting the agreed standards. If performance falls short, there are often penalties or compensations involved.
Example:
If uptime drops below 99.9%, the provider may offer service credits (like one month free).

3) Improves trust between provider and user : By clearly stating commitments, SLAs help build trust and transparency in the relationship.
How it helps:
Clients feel more secure knowing they can expect a certain level of service.

4) Measures service quality : SLAs provide a benchmark for evaluating the service provider’s performance over time.
How it's done:
Service metrics are tracked and reported (e.g., monthly uptime reports). 

5) Guides improvement (by tracking breaches) : When SLAs are not met (called SLA breaches), they serve as learning opportunities.
Example:
If ticket resolution time exceeds SLA limits repeatedly, it indicates a process issue.

📌IT Example Scenario
Imagine a hospital’s IT department signs an SLA with the hospital admin:
🔧 Service: Fix critical software issues
⏰ SLA: Must respond within 30 minutes and fix it within 2 hours
📊 Measurement: Monthly report showing how many tickets met the SLA

If IT fails to meet these targets often, it may trigger:
Penalties
Reviews
Process improvements

📌 Real-Life Analogy: Pizza Delivery
Think of SLA like Domino’s 30-min delivery promise:
🍕 You order pizza
⏱️ They promise: "Delivered in 30 minutes or it's free"
📦 That promise is the SLA
😕 If it’s late, they fail the SLA, and you get a compensation
So SLA = "Deal" or "Contract" on service speed/quality.
