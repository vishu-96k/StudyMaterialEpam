-In that library there were many blocks, library was divide by rows to columns, and having many blocks in one row, there were many partitions also. For the libray and team it was becoming very difficult to make sure that there is sequential approach or pattern to be given for keeping the books, and keep a track of what is available and what is not .
-So they derived this Practice called ITIL there for managing the libray in the Uk.
-the library university was a LAW based university in UK, And very soon they converted it into govt controlled LAW based university.
-all this happen in 1980s.
-So in the end they wanted a systematic approach in order to meet the need of the end user, is fulfilled, and the services are maintained.
-So it was made so that none of the single person is turned to be short of what he or she wants.
-so the library was maintained, in form of sections, rows and columns , and copies were keept in the departments, and for eg, if it was a navy sections, then in that sections all the books related to the navy were keept, like this they maintained the library.
