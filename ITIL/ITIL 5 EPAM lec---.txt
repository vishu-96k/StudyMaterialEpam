-EVENT : event is an any detectabke change or notification in an IT system
	In simple words, anything happend in the system, like Eg, mouse hover, or a button prsss is an event.

	EG :A user logs in → Event
	    CPU usage increases/decreasing → Event
-EVENET MANAGAEMENT is done using monitoring tool 

-ALRETS : Alert is a notification sent to a system or person when something needs attension, or when any important event has taken place, then that event is sent as an alret to the person so that that event can be given immediate actioin.
-Alerts are created when an event crosses a threshold.

-Alerts do not always need immediate action — they are just warnings.
Examples:
CPU usage above 80% → Alert
Disk space less than 20% → Alert
