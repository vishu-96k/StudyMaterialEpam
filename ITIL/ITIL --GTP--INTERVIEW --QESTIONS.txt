ITIL --GTP--INTERVIEW --QESTIONS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔹 1. What is ITIL and why is it important in Application Support?
Answer:
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework of best practices for IT Service Management.
In Application Support, ITIL ensures that every incident, request, and change is handled in a standardized, measurable, and efficient way — leading to minimal downtime, better customer satisfaction, and predictable service delivery.

🔹 2. Explain the difference between an Incident and a Service Request.
Answer:
Incident: An unplanned interruption or degradation in service (e.g., application not loading, job failure).
Service Request: A user request for information or access (e.g., password reset, granting access).
In CTCO-AMS context: You’ll log and resolve incidents in ServiceNow (or a similar ITSM tool), while routing service requests as per defined workflows.


🔹 3. What are the key ITIL processes you handle in a 24x7 managed support project?

Answer:

Incident Management – restoring service ASAP.

Problem Management – identifying root cause to reduce recurring incidents.

Change Management – ensuring controlled implementation of fixes.

Service Request Management – handling user requests systematically.

Knowledge Management – maintaining SOPs and KB articles for faster resolution.

🔹 4. What is the difference between Incident Management and Problem Management?
Answer:
Incident Management: Focuses on quick restoration of service.
Problem Management: Focuses on identifying and eliminating root causes.
Example:
If “Login failure” happens repeatedly, Incident Mgmt resolves each occurrence, while Problem Mgmt analyzes logs, finds root cause (e.g., DB timeout), and implements a permanent fix.



🔹 5. How do you prioritize incidents in a support environment?

Answer:
By Impact (how many users/business functions affected) and Urgency (how quickly it must be fixed).
Typical matrix:
| Priority | Description | Example                        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| P1       | Critical    | Application down for all users |
| P2       | High        | Major feature not working      |
| P3       | Medium      | Partial functionality issue    |
| P4       | Low         | Minor UI issue or request      |


🔹 6. What are SLAs and how do you ensure compliance?

Answer:
SLA (Service Level Agreement) defines time limits for resolution or response.
In CTCO-AMS, you’ll monitor SLA breaches using dashboards in the ITSM tool and ensure quick escalation for high-priority tickets.
Automation and proactive monitoring can help maintain SLA compliance.



🔹 7. How would you reduce ticket inflow in a managed services engagement?

Answer:

Automate frequent tasks (e.g., password resets, health checks).

Create self-help KB articles and FAQs.

Perform root-cause analysis for repeated incidents.

Coordinate with development for permanent fixes.

Set up proactive monitoring and alerting.

🔹 8. Explain the Incident Lifecycle.

Answer:

Incident Detection / Logging

Categorization & Prioritization

Investigation & Diagnosis

Resolution & Recovery

Closure

Review (if required)

Each step is tracked in ITSM tools like ServiceNow or Remedy to ensure accountability and traceability.

🔹 9. How do you handle a major incident (P1)?

Answer:

Acknowledge and log immediately.

Inform stakeholders and start bridge call.

Work with L2/L3 teams for quick workaround.

Provide regular updates (every 30 mins or as per policy).

After resolution, perform a Post-Incident Review (PIR) to identify preventive actions.

🔹 10. What is a Knowledge Base and why is it important?

Answer:
A Knowledge Base stores resolutions, known errors, and SOPs.
It reduces MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) and helps new team members solve issues faster — critical for 24x7 teams with shift rotations like CTCO-AMS.

🔹 11. What is the difference between a Workaround and a Permanent Fix?

Answer:

Workaround: Temporary solution to restore service quickly.

Permanent Fix: Final resolution to eliminate root cause, usually after analysis by L2/L3 teams.

🔹 12. How do you manage Change Requests in ITIL?

Answer:
Changes (like code deployments or configuration updates) must follow a Change Management process — logging, assessing impact, approval (CAB), scheduling, and post-implementation review.
This prevents unexpected outages in production systems.

🔹 13. What metrics or KPIs do you monitor in Application Support?

Answer:

Incident volume trend

SLA compliance %

MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)

Reopened tickets count

Ticket automation success rate

Recurring incidents count

These help identify areas for process improvement and automation opportunities.

🔹 14. How do you ensure smooth shift handovers in a 24x7 environment?

Answer:

Maintain a handover log with open tickets, pending tasks, and key observations.

Update ticket notes before EOD.

Brief next shift on ongoing major issues or upcoming changes.
This ensures zero information loss and continuous support coverage.

🔹 15. How do you contribute to continuous improvement in ITIL-based support?

Answer:

Participate in Problem Management and RCA sessions.

Suggest automation scripts for repetitive manual tasks.

Update knowledge base with new findings.

Review and improve monitoring alerts.

Track recurring issues and propose preventive actions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ Section 1: ITIL + Technical Blend
🔹 1. What steps do you take when you receive a P1 incident during your shift?

Answer:

Acknowledge the incident immediately in the ITSM tool.

Join or initiate a bridge call if the issue impacts production.

Analyze application and system logs to identify the root cause.

If possible, apply a temporary workaround (restart service, clear cache, etc.).

Update the incident with details and inform stakeholders periodically.

After resolution, document RCA and preventive measures in the Knowledge Base.

🔹 2. You get a “Login failed for all users” issue in a web app. How will you proceed?

Answer:

Check application logs for authentication errors.

Verify DB connectivity and service health (DB down or credentials expired?).

Check recent deployments or configuration changes.

Restart affected service if approved by the change window.

If resolved — close with RCA; if recurring — raise a Problem ticket for L3 to fix root cause.

ITIL Mapping: Incident → Escalation → Root Cause → Problem → Permanent Fix.

🔹 3. How do you differentiate when to raise a Problem ticket from an Incident?

Answer:
If the same incident keeps repeating or affects multiple users repeatedly — that’s a Problem.
Example: If “Job X fails every Monday,” instead of just fixing each failure, you raise a Problem Record to identify the underlying cause (like a missing dependency).

🔹 4. A ticket has breached SLA. What actions will you take?

Answer:

Check the cause of the delay and update ticket notes with justification.

Notify your Team Lead / Service Manager immediately.

Work on a workaround or escalate to the next support level.

Review in daily stand-up to ensure it doesn’t repeat.

Suggest automation or monitoring to detect similar issues early.

🔹 5. What will you do if a scheduled job fails in production?

Answer:

Review job logs to identify the error.

Check dependencies (files, DB connections, external API calls).

Restart the job manually if within scope.

If failure affects business SLAs, raise a P2/P1 incident.

Update ticket with details and RCA; create a Problem record if it’s a recurring job failure.

💻 Section 2: Tool & Log-Based Questions
🔹 6. What tools do you use for monitoring and ticketing?

Answer:
Typically tools include:

Ticketing: ServiceNow, BMC Remedy, Jira Service Desk

Monitoring: Dynatrace, AppDynamics, Splunk, Grafana, or CloudWatch

Automation: PowerShell, Python scripts, or Ansible jobs

In CTCO-AMS, you’d use an ITSM tool (like ServiceNow) integrated with monitoring for auto-ticket creation.

🔹 7. How do you check application health proactively?

Answer:

Monitor dashboards (CPU, memory, response time).

Review automated alerts.

Perform scheduled health checks (log sizes, service uptime, DB connectivity).

Validate critical job completion before business hours.

🔹 8. What are common automation opportunities in Application Support?

Answer:

Auto-restart of failed services/jobs.

Log monitoring scripts to detect recurring errors.

Auto-close stale tickets.

Auto notifications for SLA breach warnings.

API-based health checks.

Goal: Reduce inflow of manual tickets and repetitive fixes — a key CTCO-AMS expectation.

🔹 9. What’s your process for analyzing logs during an incident?

Answer:

Identify log path (application, server, or DB logs).

Search by timestamp, error ID, or user session.

Use grep, tail -f, or Splunk queries to filter.

Correlate logs with user activity and recent changes.

Share analysis with L2/L3 for RCA if needed.

🔹 10. How do you ensure configuration changes don’t break production?

Answer:
Through Change Management:

Log a Change Request (CR) with details and rollback plan.

Get CAB approval.

Test changes in lower environments first.

Deploy during a scheduled window.

Verify after deployment and close CR with post-change validation.

🧠 Section 3: Scenario & Behavioral (How You Think)
🔹 11. You notice a pattern of recurring tickets for the same issue every day. What will you do?

Answer:

Document pattern (time, system, users affected).

Raise a Problem ticket for permanent fix.

Suggest an automation to detect or self-heal the issue.

Share KB with team to reduce MTTR until fix is implemented.

🔹 12. Describe how you ensure quality handovers between shifts.

Answer:

Maintain updated ticket notes.

Document all open incidents, pending escalations, and major issues.

Use a shared handover sheet or dashboard.

Verbally brief next shift if there’s a critical ongoing P1/P2.

🔹 13. How do you communicate with users during critical outages?

Answer:

Send initial acknowledgment immediately.

Provide periodic updates (every 30 mins or as per policy).

Share workarounds, ETAs, and final RCA after resolution.

Keep communication clear and professional to maintain user trust.

🔹 14. What would you do if multiple incidents are reported simultaneously?

Answer:

Prioritize based on impact and urgency (P1 > P2 > P3).

Assign or escalate high-priority ones first.

Inform shift lead for resource reallocation.

Keep stakeholders informed on critical ones.

🔹 15. What’s your contribution to reducing ticket volume in your previous projects?

Answer (example format):

“In my previous support project, I identified repeated password reset and file cleanup issues. I automated them using PowerShell scripts and scheduled CRON jobs — which reduced manual tickets by 30%. I also updated KB articles to guide users for self-resolution.”
