🔍 1. ServiceNow

Overview: Most popular enterprise ITIL tool; used by 80% of Fortune 500 companies.

Supports: All ITIL v4 processes — Incident, Problem, Change, CMDB, Knowledge, SLA tracking, and workflows.

Features:

Dashboard-based ticket tracking.

Self-service portal for end users.

Automation using Flow Designer.

Integration with monitoring tools (like Splunk, SolarWinds).

Real-life Example:

A user raises a “login failure” ticket → routed automatically to L1 → resolved → SLA timer tracked.

If unresolved in 30 mins → escalates automatically (via workflow).

✅ Why interviewers like it:
Because it’s the most common platform used in managed service and IT support projects.

🔍 2. BMC Remedy / Helix ITSM

Supports: Incident, Problem, Change, Asset, Knowledge, Release management.

Features:

Strong workflow engine and CMDB.

Integration with BMC Discovery and monitoring tools.

Role-based dashboards.

Real-life Example:

A database outage triggers an event in monitoring → auto-generates incident in BMC → L2 DBA fixes → Problem record created for RCA → Change created for patch deployment.

✅ Used by: IBM, Accenture, HP, Capgemini, TCS, etc.

🔍 3. Jira Service Management (Atlassian)

Overview: Popular ITIL-compliant tool integrated with Agile/DevOps projects.

Supports: Incident, Change, Problem, Request Management.

Features:

Tight integration with Jira Software → developers and support teams collaborate.

Automation and SLA timers built in.

Customer portal for self-service.

Real-life Example:

User raises a “bug ticket” → support creates “incident” in Jira Service Management → linked directly to “developer issue” in Jira → both teams work together until resolved.

✅ Common in: Tech companies, DevOps, and Managed Application Support teams.


🔍 6. SolarWinds Service Desk

Overview: ITSM + strong event/alert monitoring tool.

Supports: Incident, Event, Change, Asset Management.

Features:

Auto ticket creation from alerts.

CMDB and inventory management.

SLA compliance dashboard.

Real-life Example:

CPU usage exceeds 95% on a server → alert → incident created in SolarWinds → engineer investigates and resolves → problem record created.

✅ Used in: Infrastructure & network managed service projects.

DIFF BETWEEN v3 and v4


📌 1. Focus / Approach

ITIL v3:

ITIL v3 mainly focused on processes — it tells you how to do each task step by step.

Everything had a fixed flow — you follow it like a rulebook.
👉 Example: In “Incident Management,” you first detect the issue → log it → categorize → resolve → close.

ITIL v4:

ITIL v4 focuses on practices and creating value for both business and customers.

It promotes teamwork, flexibility, and continuous improvement.
👉 Example: The IT team and business team work together to make users happy, not just fix technical problems.

📌 2. Framework Type

ITIL v3:

It followed a linear (step-by-step) model, just like the waterfall method — one stage completes before another starts.
👉 Example: You first design the service, then transition, then operate.

ITIL v4:

ITIL v4 is flexible and modern — it connects people, technology, and processes.

It allows small, quick changes using methods like Agile, DevOps, and Lean.
👉 Example: You can make updates weekly or daily, not wait months for big releases.

🔹 3. Core Concept

ITIL v3:

Based on the Service Lifecycle Model (5 stages). Each service moves through these stages from creation to improvement.

ITIL v4:

Introduces Service Value System (SVS) — shows how all components work together to create value.

Also adds the Four Dimensions Model:

Organization & People

Information & Technology

Partners & Suppliers

Value Streams & Processes

👉 Meaning: ITIL v4 looks at the entire picture, not just IT processes.

🔹 4. Objective

ITIL v3:

The main aim was to deliver IT services efficiently and reliably.

IT was treated like a support department.

ITIL v4:

Focuses on value co-creation, where IT and business work together to reach goals.
👉 Example: IT helps launch business apps faster to increase sales — both benefit.

🔹 5. Structure

ITIL v3 (5 Stages):

Service Strategy

Service Design

Service Transition

Service Operation

Continual Service Improvement (CSI)

ITIL v4 (6 Components of SVS):

Guiding Principles

Governance

Service Value Chain

Practices

Continual Improvement

Inputs & Outputs (Opportunity and Demand → Value)

👉 Meaning: ITIL v4 connects everything — from customer demand to service value creation.

🔹 6. Key Elements

ITIL v3:

Had 26 processes and 4 functions (like Service Desk, Technical Management).

ITIL v4:

Replaced these with 34 management practices — which include people, tools, and methods.
👉 Example: “Incident Management” now covers automation tools and team culture, not just steps.

🔹 7. Guiding Principles

ITIL v3:

Guiding principles were mentioned only in CSI — not given much importance.

ITIL v4:

Has 7 guiding principles to follow everywhere:

Focus on value

Start where you are

Progress iteratively (small steps with feedback)

Collaborate and show visibility

Think and work holistically

Keep it simple and practical

Optimize and automate

👉 Meaning: Follow these principles in every IT or business process.

🔹 8. Integration with Modern Practices

ITIL v3:

Was created before Agile, DevOps, and Cloud were popular.

Didn’t support them fully.

ITIL v4:

Fully supports Agile (speed), DevOps (collaboration), and Cloud (scalability).
👉 Example: Automating deployments using DevOps pipelines is encouraged in ITIL v4.

🔹 9. Value Creation

ITIL v3:

IT was seen as just a service provider.

ITIL v4:

IT and business work together to create value.
👉 Example: IT team helps launch a new online feature that boosts business revenue.

🔹 10. Roles & Responsibilities

ITIL v3:

Each process had a specific role (like Incident Manager, Change Manager).

ITIL v4:

Roles are flexible and team-based — encourages collaboration.
👉 Example: In DevOps, the same team manages coding, deployment, and incident handling.

🔹 11. Tools & Automation

ITIL v3:

Manual, less use of automation tools.

ITIL v4:

Strong focus on automation, AI, and monitoring tools to improve speed and accuracy.
👉 Example: Monitoring tools like Splunk automatically raise incident tickets.

🔹 12. Documentation Style

ITIL v3:

Heavy documentation and strict forms for every process.

ITIL v4:

Light, simplified documentation — only what’s useful.
👉 Example: Dashboards or short checklists instead of long process manuals.

🔹 13. Flexibility

ITIL v3:

Rigid and rule-based — everyone must follow the same process.

ITIL v4:

Flexible and adaptable — organizations can customize practices to their needs.
👉 Example: A small company might use only a few ITIL practices instead of all.

🔹 14. Terminology Example

ITIL v3:

Used words like “Process” and “Function.”

ITIL v4:

Uses “Practice” — meaning people + process + tools together.
👉 Example: “Change Management Practice” includes approval steps + automation tools + team communication.

🔹 15. Continual Improvement

ITIL v3:

“Continual Service Improvement (CSI)” was a separate final stage.

ITIL v4:

Improvement happens everywhere and all the time — built into all activities.
👉 Example: After every incident, the team checks what can be improved immediately.
